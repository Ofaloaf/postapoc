# Turn this on to spit out errors when you use something that is valid, but causes bugginess in one
# of the patches. Note that if you turn this on, the error messages will not look any different from
# if you had made an error. So e.g. if the add_betrothal command is broken, and you use it, then
# the Validator will say something like "add_betrothal is not a valid child" without explaining that
# it is invalid because it doesn't work in the latest patch. So be careful if you turn this on, and

# Disable checks for missing option, desc, picture in events without hide_window=yes.
# NOTE: This was renamed from Event.NoNonHideWindowChecks
#AddFlag = Events.NoNonHideWindowChecks
# Disables warnings about possible ID collisions.
# Reason for warnings: Could you add a warning if a non-namespace event ID is greater than 999999, or a namespace event ID is greater than 99999? These have the potential of causing an ID collision between non-namespace and namespace IDs, or between namespaces, because of the way event ID blocks are assigned to namespaces (100000 ID blocks, starting at 1000000.) 
#AddFlag = Event.NoCheckIdCollision
# Disable checking for leading zeros in event IDs. It is good to have a uniform ID for each event.

# TITLES
###########################################

# Allows duplicate entries in the landed_titles, as titles will get merged. Note this disables some related checks, such as that a color is specified
AddFlag = Titles.AllowDuplicateEntries
# For emperor/king/duke titles, will not enforce that they have a capital
# Note that this may be a risky thing to do so be careful
# zijistark says this: Titular titles don't strictly need capital assignments. However, titular titles can and do become de jure either by event or through drift, although obviously some special-purpose titular titles will never do so, depending upon the mod. IMHO, it'd be a best practice to always assign capitals to titles, even if a titular title such as e_summer_sea receives a placeholder capital like province 1. Titles that end-up de jure w/o a capital can cause numerous issues-- a) they screw with game mechanics re: free capital movement and AI capital choice, b) the assumption that de jure titles have a capital is a very useful one to make in general-purpose script, and c) such titles without capitals will never match a GeographicalRegion even when they really ought to do so and may cause abnormal or incoherent behavior as a result.
