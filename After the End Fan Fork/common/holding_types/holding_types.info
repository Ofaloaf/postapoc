It is not possible to add new holding types, but you can define the conditions for being allowed to build each holding type.

Currently, the only thing supported within a holding is "trigger", which defines when it can be built. ROOT is the province, while FROM is the builder.
Some hardcoded restrictions also apply and cannot at this time be overridden.

Example of how trigger can be used:
trigger = { FROM = { prestige = 1000 } }
