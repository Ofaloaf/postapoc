### Statuses are modifiers so they can contain the same things are other modifiers
# however they are not applied to a character but to the offmap_power
# they can also have flags that can be tested from the offmap_power scope
#
# If a power's current status or current policy has the flag, the power will be considered as having it

# moved the triggers and effects to offmap_powers.info doc

frame = 2 		# set the GFX frame to use for the status/policy
