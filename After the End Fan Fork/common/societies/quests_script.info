### Triggers for quest (secret societies missions):
any_quester_targetting_this 		# scope must be a character, landed title or province, returns true if any character with a quest targetting the current scope fulfills the condition
any_quester							# returns true if a character with a quest fulfills the condition
is_quest_target = yes				# scope must be a character, landed title or province, and returns true if the current scope is targetted by any quest
is_quest_target_of = character		# scope must be a character, landed title or province, and returns true if the current scope is targetted by any quest the character has
has_any_quest = yes 				# scope must be a character, return true if scoped character has one or more quests
has_quest = quest_name 				# scope must be a character, return true if scoped character has a quest with the given quest_name

### Scope Switch for quests
quest_target 						# scope must be a character, returns the current target of that character's quest
