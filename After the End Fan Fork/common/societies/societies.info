opinion_to_other_members, integer, 		the opinion modifier applied when both characters are members
opinion_to_pretenders, integer,			the opinion modifier from a member towards someone who is perceived to be a member but is not
opinion_to_perceived_members, integer,	the opinion modifier from a non-member toward someone who is perceived to be a member
opinion_per_rank_above, integer, the opinion bonus characters in the society get for how much they're outranked by another member. E.G., if the bonus is 5, someone at rank 1 will get a +15 bonus with someone at rank 4
custom_tooltip, a localisation key for modifiers in society ranks that is localized and added to the tooltip for rank icons
society_rank_up_decision, a key for the decision that ranks up a member in the society
sound, a key for a sound effect to play while the society is selected in the societies tab. The sound key is defined in interface/sound.sfx
obedient, used within society_rank to define when other (AI) characters in the society will be obedient (roughly equivalent to "debug_yesmen") towards characters of this rank. ROOT is the rank holder, FROM is the potentially obedient character
obedience_tooltip, string, the localisation key to be shown for the given rank, explaining what characters are obedient
non_interference, global to the society itself. Non-interfering AI characters will not take any hostile action towards the character. Only characters within the society will be non-interfering. ROOT is the target of diplomatic actions. FROM is the character taking the action
non_interference_tooltip, string, the localisation key to be shown under "influence", explaining what characters are non-interfering
devil_worshipper, bool, used for the is_devil_worshipper trigger. Also suppresses the "religious differences" opinion modifiers with other members of the same society
criminal, bool, used for the is_criminal trigger
active, trigger, used to determine if the society is active. If not met, it will be impossible to see or join the society, and no members will be generated for it at game start, and all existing members will be booted out of it within a month. Note that events and the like that reference the society will continue to act as if the society existed normally. Note that the conditions for this trigger are not shown in the UI anywhere, so you may want a global event or similar if this is something that can happen *during* a campaign. ROOT is the society
indestructible, bool, used to determine whether a society is "indestructible". Indestructible societies will use the startup_populate trigger to find an existing character to lead the society. It will choose the character in the world who would get the highest society membership score, with landed characters having their score reduced to 1/100th of what they'd otherwise get, since affecting a landed character is much more disruptive than affecting a courtier. If there's no eligible character, the on_society_failed_to_find_new_leader on-action will fire
template, bool, indicates whether the society is a template. See dynamic_societies.info for an explanation of what that means
associated_religion, string, defines what religion is associated with the society. Is used for religion triggers, effects, and similar
