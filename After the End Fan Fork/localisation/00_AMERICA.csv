BM_FIAT_HOMO_DESC;The world suffered tremendously from the Event, but did not die out completely. Although scarred, the Earth still provides home for humanity. Now, in the midst of the 27th century, one part of the world is beginning to organize themselves, to rebuild and expand outward. Driven by greed, by righteousness, by bloodlust and by all the sins and virtues, rulers and adventurers will reshape the world. Let there be man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FLORIDA_WAR;The Great Florida War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FLORIDA_WAR_DESC;After the death of Empress Portia, the unpopular Stepping Razor ascended the Caribbean throne. Seeking an enemy to unite the archipelago against, he embarked on an invasion of Confederate Florida in concert with their Tuskegean enemies. Meanwhile, a great army assembles in Quebec under the banner of St. Ursula, seeking to save the souls of New Englanders from eternal damnation and perhaps gain worldly rewards in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_INDIAN_COUNTRY_DESC;The mass destruction of the Old World was, in many ways, a godsend for the Indians of Old America. With the governments that once oppressed them destroyed, the Native Americans were free of the reservation system, and began expanding outwards once more. Unlike the days before the Indian Wars however, these revitalized nations are now a minority in their own lands, and have had to compromise their rule with Anglo-American vassals and acknowledgement of the Papacy in New Rome. In such a state, can the Indians survive in this new world?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Can its wildest ambitions ever match up with reality? What of the Southern dukes and counts who refuse to bend knee?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The mighty empire of California, which enjoyed centuries of stable rule over nearly all the west coast, has been thrown into chaos by six warring kingdoms, each desiring control over the Emperor and harboring their own ambitions, while the Cascadian kings struggle against Haida invasions, the Mormons of Deseret spread their faith northwards at swordpoint, and Arixan cowboys clash with Navajo, Hopi, and tinkers of the Atomicist faith. Can the peace so many sing about ever be restored to the region?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Atom-worshipping lords of Sonora and Tejano conquerors of Sierra Madre threaten the followers of El Santo, Our Lady of Guadalupe, and Santa Muerte in the north. The Kingdom of Yucatan is strong, but dissension between Yucatecs and Mayas threatens it from within as the growing Caribbean Empire threatens it from without.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_1910107;California has seen better days. The Emperor has become a mere figurehead, with his former governors acting as independent rulers in all but name. Can you reunite California under its divinely-ordained ruler, or will disharmony and strife continue to reign?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_2000011;Duchess Portia of Jamaica has built a great empire through conquest and diplomacy. But as she grows old, earls and marquises plot to break away or gain the throne for themselves, united only in hatred for the vile Prince Barrington. Worshippers of the orishas, the loa, and Jah are in constant conflict. Can you hold the Caribbean together, or will the Empire survive only as a historical footnote?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1788001;Hudsonia's fortunes have declined somewhat, from its glory days under the Rodham kings. Although the realm is mostly united, the authority of the crown is weakened, and Baltus III Groot's reign is plagued by religious strife, disloyal vassals, Rodham claimants to the throne and the perpetual threat of Occultists to the east. Can you ride the storm and restore Hudsonia to its old strength, or are Baltus and his kingdom doomed to obscurity?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1861001;305 years after its founding, the Holy Columbian Confederacy is one of the most powerful and stable realms east of the Mississippi, a cornerstone of chivalric culture in the Americas, and self-proclaimed successor to Old America. As its newest emperor, Algernon III has a lot to live up to, and the reality of power isn't the stuff of songs. In an empire beset with the threat of rebellion, constant intrigue in the halls of power, and religious turmoil foreign and domestic, can you prove yourself worthy to wear the crown?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1620100;Centuries ago, the House of Mahonic ruled a mighty, prosperous kingdom that united almost all the Northeast, and became a name known - and feared - by every living thing east of the Mississippi. Now, though, those days are but memories, living only in tomes from the great Crimson Library or the tales your father lulled you to sleep with during your childhood, and you are the last. The road before you is treacherous, but not hopeless - play your cards right, and maybe you can return your family, and your people, to their former glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1788002;The Big Apple isn't anywhere near the grandeur of its pre-cataclysmic days, but it has survived and rebuilt, retaking its place as one of the Americas' economic and cultural capitals. Over the centuries, the Republic has braved war and calamity, even surrounded by the many factions of the tumultuous Northeast. You are the latest in a long line to guide the city that never sleeps, but beware: your fellow patricians are ambitious, Americanists have few friends among their neighbors, and war is almost more common in the region than trade. Will New York prosper under your rule, or is the great city doomed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1867007;Long ago, before the cataclysm that engulfed the ancient world, Ontario was capital to the empire of Canada, which counted itself among Old America's closest friends. Canada is long gone, but under the House of Laurier, Ontario has built itself anew, braving the storms that have beset its fellow Canadian kingdoms as well as the Northeast in general. Not all is well, however, as the Rust Cultists of the Midwest are a constant threat, as are the conflicts between the High Church, Ursulines and Evangelicals, and the bloody, ever-changing politics of the eastern seaboard. Under By's reign, will Ontario continue its rise to greatness, or will the Canadian dream finally come to an end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1967004;Detroit is basically the exact same as before the apocalypse. Why do you live there? Move somewhere nice, like the Californian Empire. This description to be replaced soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1933005;Life on the border of the largest empire in the new world can be a profitable one... if you're an Evangelical Christian. Unfortunately for the political future of the tribe of Tenesi, High Chief Ellis is a zealous Revelationist who would not think of compromising his mystical ideals to placate his neighbors. A magnetic personality and dashing good looks may have allowed him to bring Revelationist lands under his control, but will it take a miracle to keep hold of his conquests in the face of Confederate domination?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1836000;Old Count Abner has weathered great misfortune in his long life. His firstborn son Taddeo died in infancy. His younger brother wrangled his way into the service of Duke Denton of Metroplex and now stands to inherit a realm greater than Abner's own inheritance. Even God appears to have turned His back on Abner, for Voodoo mystics threaten his southern frontier as his fellow Catholics - true adherents of Christ - bicker amongst themselves and snap at one another's domains. But Abner still draws breath, and his sword as well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3000000;The Latimer family of Tuskegee enjoy a place of privilege on the western frontier of the Holy Columbian Confederacy. Tasked with maintaining the security of the Magnolia Marches, Duke Huey faces threats on all sides: Papists to the northwest and devil-worshipping Occultists to the north, while Voodoo sorcerers revel in the remains of New Orleans. But youthful vigor, a just heart and God himself are on his side. The disparate communities to his west will surely soon fall under the yoke of the true successor to old America!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

###########Religions###########

pirate;Pirate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
candomble;Candomblé;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
candomble_DESC;Candomblé literally means "dance in honor of the gods," and as is to be expected from the name many rituals involve music and dance. Practitioners worship a creator deity named Olodumaré, as well as numerous lesser spirits called Orishas, and often make ritual offerings to them. Candomblé is a syncretic faith that absorbed religious traditions from West Africans, Portuguese Catholics, and indigenous South Americans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
thelemic;Thelemic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
thelemic_DESC;Thelema is a British mystic religion developed by Aleister Crowley, based on the law: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neognostic;Neo-Gnostic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neognostic_DESC;Neo-Gnostism (re)emerged in Colorado as a syncretic faith combining teachings coming from the the Cetic west and the Catholic east. Neo-Gnostics have amalgamated the belief in the Christian God with the rejection of the material world often found in Cetic schools of thought. They believe that Salvation can be found in worship of Christ and that they can find Enlightment through his teachings. Gnostics see material processions and desires as secondary to Oneness with God. They reject the material world (matter, flesh) as being the work of Satan and seek to embrace the 'Gnosis' of God (knowledge, enlightenment, salvation). \n§Y*§! Are considered a Catholic heresy owing to their agreement with the Catholic understanding of God and the Saints, while dismissing the teachings of most Cetic Gurus.\n§Y*§! May have ambitions to remove vices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sedevacantist;Sedevacantist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sedevacantist_DESC;The name Sedevancantists comes from the Latin term 'Sede Vacante', meaning 'the seat is vacant'. Sedevacantists reject the authority of the Pope of New Rome, denying his right to call himself successor of the Pope of Old Rome because it cannot be established if the Papacy of the Old World still exists. Even if it has ceased to exist, they reject the notion that the Bishop of New Rome (St. Louis) could or should have the same authority as the original Pope. They argue that the Primacy of Rome cannot be duplicated merely out of convenience, feel the Bishop of New Rome has no more right to be head of their faith than any other bishop in the land, and call his College of Cardinals a sham and cabal of co-conspirators. Instead, Sedevancantists believe the office of Pope should be considered 'vacant' until a true Pope returns, unless it can be confirmed the original Papacy is no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ursuline;Ursuline;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ursuline_DESC;The Ursulines originated as an antediluvian religious order, patronized by Saint Ursula. Introduced to the Americas during the colonial era, their presence could be found wherever the French colonized. During and shortly after the great cataclysm, Quebecois Roman Catholics, unable to contact old Rome, turned to the Ursuline order for leadership. Since then the Ursulines have served as Quebec's continuation of antediluvian Catholicism, and their followers have steadfastly refused to recognize the American Pope in New Rome. Defining features in-game:\n§Y*§! The Abbess-General is elected via the same mechanics as the Pope.\n§Y*§! Women are the only ones who can become cardinals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
angeline;Angeline;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
angeline_DESC;Angelines live very different lives from their Ursuline counterparts. Whereas the Ursulines emphasize the monastic lifestyle and the primacy of the Church, Angelines more strongly emphasize cohabitation with the secular world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anabaptist;Anabaptist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anabaptist_DESC;The Anabaptists are a branch of Christianity originating from 16th century Europe, and the forebears of American groups such as the Amish, Hutterites and Mennonites, which banded together to survive the post-cataclysm world. Anabaptists believe Christians should remain separate from the rest of the world, refuse to hold office and refrain from violence even in war or self-defence, tenets which make life after the apocalypse difficult, and often quite short.\n§Y*§! Due to their avoidance of violence when possible, cannot use the Holy War CB.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evangelical;Evangelical;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evangelical_DESC;The Evangelical Church is what remains of antediluvian Protestantism. In the face of post-deluge upheavals, the Protestant churches banded together, putting aside minor theological differences in favor of establishing an Evangelical Convention of Churches presided over by an ecumenical council of bishops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
high_church;High Church;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
high_church_DESC;High Church followers lean heavily on older Christian traditions and a sense of ritual more in line with Catholicism that with Evangelical Protestantism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
antinomian;Antinomian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
antinomian_DESC;Antinomianism is a theological doctrine which predates the apocalypse, and takes the Protestant notion of 'sola fide'- salvation by 'faith alone'- to its extreme, rejecting not just Old Testament ceremonial laws but all of the laws laid down by Moses. This rejection of Mosaic law- or 'moral law'- absolutely drives mainstream Protestantism nuts and has been a thorny issue since the days of Martin Luther.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
postadventist;Postadventist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
postadventist_DESC;Postadventists believe that the Second Coming has already happened, that Jesus came to judge the living and the dead... and was not pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
charismatic;Charismatic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
charismatic_DESC;Charismatics are not known as such because of their charm, but rather their belief in 'charismata', gifts of the Holy Spirit manifested in miracles and signs that can be endowed simply by baptism and faith in the Holy Spirit. Such wonders include the ability to speak in tongues, miraculous healing of the cripples, gifts of prophecy and more events often considered 'supernatural'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dark_pagan_group;Dark Pagan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
occultist;Occultist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
occultist_DESC;Occultist followers believe that the universe is a vast mystery, with the dark corners of reality holding innumerable secrets and dangers. The fragments of ancient lore that survived the Fall have formed the core of a new polytheistic faith quite at odds with most others. Defining features in-game: \n§Y*§! Have access to the conquest Casus belli \n§Y*§! Have access to the subjugation Casus belli;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
occultist_reformed;Occultist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
occultist_reformed_DESC;Occultist followers believe that the universe is a vast mystery, with the dark corners of reality holding innumerable secrets and dangers. The fragments of ancient lore that survived the Fall have formed the core of a new polytheistic faith quite at odds with most others. The reformed Occultist church has a new hierarchy and more standardised set of texts. Defining features in-game: \n§Y*§! Have access to the conquest Casus belli \n§Y*§! Have access to the subjugation Casus belli;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
atomicist;Atomicist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
atomicist_DESC;Atomicists worship elements of old world technology and hold sacred the places 'touched by the Almighty Atom'. Although atomic theory is practically forgotten, Atomicists understand that there is an invisible world out there which houses vast power. If they could but find a way to tap into this intangible world, they believe they would become gods themselves! The tumors and radiation sickness, though, they don't talk about as much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
americanist;Americanist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
americanist_DESC;Americanists worship what must have been the true gods of the old world-- the statues of Father Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson and others clearly indicates who the ancient Americans worshipped.

hamiltonian;Hamiltonian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hamiltonian_DESC;Hamiltonians differ from mainstream Americanism in that they take their faith in the gods of the Old World to a higher level. Legends outline the gods' abilities and deeds, but Hamiltonians believe the gods had more powers beyond those explicitly stated. They hold, furthermore, that it is within the capabilities of all believers to attain these 'implied powers' for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

jeffersonian_DESC;The old legends speak not of just Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, but also of the farmers, the soldiers, and all the common men of the Old World. As widespread as the statues of the Founders are, are there not statues of the common infantryman in many old towns? What of the farmers and the grand grange halls they established? Jeffersonians hold that the Americanist gods of the old world were just a few of many, and that the entire nation of ancient America was home to gods. All the land was blessed by the gods, therefore, and thus all the land must be reclaimed by the true faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In the centuries since the continued revelation and dedicated study of the First Lady and her Justices have lead the libertarians and the Americanists to opposite positions on a vast number of theological points, from the approved methods of establishing proof of presidential deification after death all the way to structure of the old world pantheon.:\n§Y*§!

voodoo_DESC;Descended from West African Vodun, Voodoo originated in 18th century Haiti, spreading later to Louisiana. Vodouists worship the creator god Bondye, but as he is unreachable they pray to his servants, the Loa, who act as intermediaries in exchange for service.

gracia_divina;Gracia Divina;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gracia_divina_DESC;The adherents of Gracia Divina hold belief in the karma like system of 'divine grace'. They believe that the greater piety and devoutness shown in life, the more fortunate their lives will become, that they literally become graced by the divine. They believe especially that devotion to specific saints/deities (the terms have been interchangeable in Gracia Divina) will lead to that Saint becoming their patron, and directly influence their lives. This can lead to very zealous devotion as the worshipper takes on an extremely personal and intimate connection with their patron. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

falling_star;Falling Star;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
falling_star_DESC;Sometime either during or just after the Apocalypse, the faith of the Falling Star believe a star fell from the heavens and onto Earth. This star was a fallen Angel, who had sacrificed themselves to save mankind from God’s wrath, explaining humanity’s survival. Practitioners of the Falling Star faith are generally viewed with suspicion by those with more traditional Christian beliefs, as the concept of Fallen Angels are generally thought of as evil, and associated with Satan. However, the Falling Star faith insist their angel has little in common with the fallen Angel Lucifer, and that their angel’s compassion reawakened God’s mercy in a moment of anger. Thus, members of the Fallen Star still fall under the Christian banner, albeit with a theology that features great devotion to their fallen 'star'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ghost_dance_DESC;Nanissáanah, known as the 'Ghost Dance', is a syncretic, reformed form of more traditional Plains Indian beliefs.

mormon;Mormon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mormon_DESC;With roots in Ancient America's frontier, Mormonism has a solid hold on many parts of the Old West. Although based in Christian foundations, the Church of Latter-Day Saints has many additional books, customs and traditions which have caused it to be treated differently from some elements of mainstream Christianity. With the chaos of the apocalypse, these attitudes were exacerbated, and Mormonism is widely treated as a wholly distinct realm from the Christian world of New Rome and the Protestantism of the East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bickertonite;Bickertonite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bickertonite_DESC;The Bickertonite faithful consider themselves the true continuation of the Mormon faith, following the events of the calamity.

strangite_DESC;The Strangites believe James Strang to be the lawful successor of Joseph Smith, and consider the historical leaders of the Mormon church to be heretics.

brethren_DESC;With a strong tradition of seafaring and a reputation for robbery and murder, most call the Brethren pirates. This assessment is not far from the truth. Though the Brethren follow a Code of the Sea, they are loosely organized and live mostly to plunder riches from the weak. All of their gods have some link to the ocean, which they consider the source of all life and all wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gaian;Gaian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gaian_reformed;Gaian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gaian_DESC;Gaians worship numerous spirits of nature, Gaia foremost among them. Also known as Earth Mother, the Goddess, or Primordia, the faithful believe Gaia is a divine spirit interconnected with all living things... the ancient soul of the Earth itself. Gaian theology encourages a society ruled by women rather than men, teaching that man neglected the world and that it was his disregard for the natural balance that led the Earth to ruin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

shinto_DESC;Shinto is an ancient religion that combines cultural rituals, animist spirit worship, and Buddhist traditions.

jewish_DESC;Judaism is one of the oldest religions on the planet, and it survived the Event like it did so many other catastrophes. Although Orthodox Judaism itself has changed relatively little over the last few centuries, the Jews of post-Event America now face discrimination and persecution on a scale unheard of since the Middle Ages of old. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Orthodox Jews still patiently await the arrival of the Moshiach, who will, in due time, gather the Jews living in exile and return them to the land promised to their forefathers. Defining features in game: \n§Y*§! A religious head, the Grand Rebbe, can be created by a powerful Jewish ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reform;Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reform_DESC;Reform Judaism first split from Orthodox Judaism in the 19th century, under the belief that in order for Judaism to survive in the modern age, it should reform to be more compatible with a modern, secular lifestyle. Reform Judaism regards Halacha (Jewish religious law) as non-binding, permits women to be ordained as rabbis, and is overall more open to external influences than Orthodox Judaism. Reform Jews actually outnumbered Orthodox Jews prior to the Event, but by 2666, Reform Judaism is the majority religion in only a single county - Palm Beach. Defining features in game: \n§Y*§! Women can be ordained as rabbis. \n§Y*§! Absolute Cognatic succession is allowed for all Reform rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
