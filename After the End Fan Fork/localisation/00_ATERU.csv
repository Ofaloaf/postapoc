EVTTITLE_zkinvestigate;The Carmine Investigation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya1;Not too long ago, the Abbas family used to rule Socal. At the hands of the great warlord Zakariyya, all of Socal had been consolidated under the great Abbas Emirate for three hundred years, which lasted until the Lawgiver's conquests. The sage ruler Musa saw the futility of resisting his armies, and bowed to the emperor as his vassal. Ever since that fated day, the Abbas family ruled in the name of the Emperor as governors of Socal. The Abbas governors cooperated dearly with their liege lords, whilst remaining true to their faith.\n However, with the Empire's grasp weakening, so did the power of the Abbas dynasty. After the sudden death of Yassir Abbas, their stewards, House Carmine, seized power via a palace-coup. Since this event, the Abbas family has suffered at their hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkinvestigate;This cannot be coincidence! Surely something is up...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkcontent; Such is the way of any dynasty. Allah intended this, and so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya2;If I am to take on the Carmine dynasty, I will need allies. My family's lands are not what they used to be, and I would stand no chance against the united armies of my liege lord. Incase this goes badly, I should have an ally to fall back on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkmarry;And what better way to secure an ally than marriage?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_zkbajaprincess;The Princess of Baja;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya3;I stand on the steps outside of my council hall, waiting as the entourage of the Princess of Baja, Christina del Caballero arrives. As the carriage comes to a stop, a courtier begins to announce the Princess, yet she does not wait for him to finish, instead opening the door on her own. Christina gets out and strides towards me, no hesitation or worry slowing her step. She comes to a stop before me, staring observantly at me. After a minute of quiet thought, she finally smiles, and greets me with a warm embrace. \n \n She whispers, "I am glad to meet you, and my brother, the King, is looking forward to a wise ruler with the interests of Baja in mind as well." With that ominous greeting finished, she pulls herself away from me and makes eye contact once more. Meeting her steady gaze, it is clear that I am looking at a woman who will either become my strongest ally or my most dangerous enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkmarry1;A marriage with her may not be happy, but it would be useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_zkjoshuatree;The Countess of Joshua Tree;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya4;News of my search for a wife has turned up an unlikely candidate, who presents herself gracefully at my court. "I present the lady Sofia Hayek, Countess of Joshua Tree." Her eyes are cast low as she bows before me, but for a short moment, her eyes dart up and meet mine. The faintest smile plays at the corners of her mouth, and a soft blush tints her cheeks. With the introduction over, her retinue retires, but I invite her to walk with me in your courtyard.\n \n  I discuss much with her - of faith, of history, and of ambition - namely my own. Before I realize it, nearly three hours have passed in pleasant conversation. She eventually bids me farewell and retires to her quarters. With so many laughs and so many conversations in such a short time, I feel like we are good friends already...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkmarry2;If not a wife, I have gained a dear friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_zkpeasant;Jazmin, the Baker's Daughter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya5;One evening at court, the stress of my investigation and your impending marriage are simply too much to bear. Interrupting me from a break in my study is a knock on the door. I motion for the visitor to be let in, and my friend, Jazmin, strolls into the room. I had already confided in her my suspicions about the death of my father, and her presence is a much-needed comfort in times such as these.\n\n She gave me a quick smile and sat next to me. Jazmin speaks to me of her visions of the future, and her hope to see my house restored to its former glory. She speaks with passion, her simple honesty, and forceful zeal both coming across as she looks me in the eyes and shocks me with a kiss. We had been friends for as long as I can remember - but what if there is more than friendship?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkmarry3;What is marriage if not for affection?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya6;I sit once more in my study, alone. I cannot quite keep my mind off of the three potential pathways for marriage I could go down- to marry a friend and lover with no power, a friend with minor resources, or a complete foreigner with the armies of a kingdom behind her. I must be firm in my resolve- who am I to marry?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkmarrybaja;The Princess of Baja will be my bride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkmarryscholar;I can trust Sofia, and she has men to her name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkmarrypeasant;My wife must be my lover, Jazmin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya7;With an ally secured, I am a bit more confident to investigate the lies of the Carmines. In secret, I have sent my couriers across Socal, looking for anyone who may have proof of the treachery that has been committed against my fathers. An informant should be arriving in Orange soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_ZKCourtierHunt; Before long, their treachery will be exposed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya9;The messengers have not returned yet. Surely someone has proof of these crimes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_ZKCourtierHuntContinue;Surely! Just a few more weeks...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_ZKCourtierHuntStop;These searches are futile... I cannot win.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya10;My search has finally yielded fruit! An Angeleno man has arrived at my court, telling me in secret that he was there at the most foul murder of my father. He has pledged allegiance to my righteous cause for vengeance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkcourtierarrived;The noose around the Carmine neck tightens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya12;The alleged witness came to me today, ushering me to meet him outside my court at night, for our halls are "riddled with the eyes of our liege." Yet I can't help but be reluctant to expose myself in such a manner. In my halls, I am defended, but outside of them, I am like any other man. What if he is a fake?\n Oh, whatever am I to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zktrust; They seem trustworthy enough. I will go and meet them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkcondemn;They are just another pawn of the Carmines!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_zktrustedwitness;The Scarab Exposed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya13;I sighed, and looked out to the door of my keep. I am really putting my life on the line here. "To meet alone is the only way to have secrecy," I grumble under my breath. But as I take steps forward through the castle's courtyard, I can't help but feel uneasy. The grip around my scimitar's handle tightens. As I walk through assorted sets of walls, it is not long before I am in the wilderness. "Im glad you came," a voice behind me calls out. In a minute, I turn with my scimitar unsheathed, yet I am only met with the sight of the Angeleno witness before me. "Lord Abbas, rightful ruler of Socal, I am not your enemy." He says calmly. "We share a common foe, and I have much to disclose to you about them." He hands me a scroll, sealed with the Scarab of House Carmine. Inscribed are the orders for the murder of my father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zktrustwitness; This is all the proof I need! I will have their heads for this!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_zkcondemnedwitness;A Murder in the Woods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya14;I sighed, and looked out to the door of my keep. I am really putting my life on the line here. Is there a better way to catch a noble than to catch him alone in the woods, without any guards? I retire to my chambers for the night, and doze off to sleep quickly.\n The words of one of my castle servants shakes me from my rest. "My lord, there is a dead peasant outside your castle. I am not quite sure what fate befell him." I immediately shot up and ran to the walls. Surely enough, the witness I hired was lying dead on the gravel, covered in lacerations. "We are not sure of his cause of death, my lord." ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkcondemnedwitness; He was a true witness indeed. And now he is lying dead on the dirt... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_zktrustedspy;The Scarab Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya16;I sighed, and looked out to the door of my keep. I am really putting my life on the line here. "To meet alone is the only way to have secrecy," I grumble under my breath. But as I take steps forward through the castle's courtyard, I can't help but feel uneasy. The grip around my scimitar's handle tightens. As I walk through assorted sets of walls, it is not long before I am in the wilderness. "Im glad you came," a voice behind me calls out. In a minute, I turn with my scimitar unsheathed, but before I can swing it for the foe before me a dagger is firm in my chest. My scimitar clangs to the ground as I collapse to my knees. The "witness" from earlier walks towards me, a disdainful look in his eyes as he grabs my sword and glances down at me. "The Carmines send their regards.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zktrustspy; N-no...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_zkcondemnedspy;A Foiled Murder;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya17;I sighed, and looked out to the door of my keep. I am really putting my life on the line here. Is there a better way to catch a noble than to catch him alone in the woods, without any guards? I retire to my chambers for the night, and doze off to sleep quickly.\n The words of one of my castle guards shakes me from my rest. "My lord, a man attempted upon your life while you slept. Rest assured, we caught him before he even set a foot in the keep." I quickly shot out of bed and walked out to the main hall of my castle. "His body is not here anymore, a castle is no fitting place for a rotting murderer. You may want to see this note, milord." The guard handed me a blood splattered note, sealed with the Scarab of House Carmine. The note detailed my own murder!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkcondemnedspy; Damned be the Carmines!! This is as proof as any!!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya18;The proof has been laid before me- there is no questioning it now. The hands of the Carmines are stained with my family's blood. Rage courses through me at the realization of this treachery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkwar; Rally the banners! We ride for Balboa!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkquiet; This is not the time for war, but my time will come soon. I must plot...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_zakariyya21;For many centuries, my family were loyal subjects of the emperor. It was the decline of the Yudkow dynasty that brought upon their demise. Many Cetics in my court argue whether or not the Yudkows have lost the heavenly right to rule California- is this so? I have a choice to support the liege of my ancestors, or go on my own path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zksocalkowtow;The Abbas dynasty will always be loyal to the emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zksocalindependent;The empire is dead- I will make my own fate for Socal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya20;[From.GetFirstNameWithDynasty], I hereby decree that you have no right to the title King, your unjust actions prove it thus. Vengeance has finally been gained against the Carmines, and now [From.GetFirstNameWithDynasty] stands before you to hear your judgment..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkexecute;The Carmines must answer for the deaths of my fathers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkmerciful;An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_zakariyya22;As I grow tired from assorted lowborn complaints on a busy day in court, I am shocked awake by the banners of Baja triumphantly flying into my room. The emissary stands before me, reading from an ornate scroll. "I do believe it is time for you to pay your dowry. Accept the Kingdom of Baja California as Suzerain, or we will meet on the field of combat.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkbajawar;I never agreed to such a deal!! To arms!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkbajapeace;My realm is too weak to afford another war. I have no choice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_carmine;"My liege, we have heard news of the upstart Abbas investigating the actions of your father." A cloaked man approaches you. You are torn- what to do? .;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_carminegood;My rule is based on a lie. I must amend this wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
carminegood;You step down and abdicate to the Abbas upstart...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_carmineneutral;I cannot give up my reign. But to do nothing is wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
carmineneutral;You confess your fathers crimes to the Abbas, but will not abdicate your throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_carminebad;He mustn't discover what my father did to Salim...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
carminebad;This upstart is put down at whatever it costs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_zkcarmineabdication;The Carmine Abdication;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya38;You weren't expecting the entourage of his majesty, the King of SoCal to appear in your court, but the bright red Scarabs of the house storm your hall, the King in his regalia approaching. "Zakariyya of Socal," he calls out, with a sorrowful look in his eyes. "I have heard of your investigations into my family history, and it is with sorrow I can say that it is true. Due to the sins of my fathers against the righteousness of this world, I have no choice but to abdicate my throne to you. I hope you are a more merciful and just liege than my father was to yours, Zakariyya of Socal." Kneeling before you, the king removes the gemmed crown from his head and offers it to you. It can be said, once more, that House Abbas has come to rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkmyreign;My reign begins now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya37;My mind is thrown into a panic as my throneroom is turned into a sea of red, as dozens of Carmine banners fly into my room. At the head of a magnificent entourage is none other than the King of Socal. "My family has wronged you, and I offer my apologies. But I cannot afford to step down. I must right their wrongs.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zk37a;I understand. Rule well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zk37b;This doesn't begin to pay for my fathers death!! To arms!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya24;I have received a summons from the Imperial Court. His majesty, the emperor of the Celestial Empire of California, has summoned me on urgent duty, regarding my recent seizure of the Kingdom of Socal. If his demands are too unreasonable, Socal is not obliged to listen to his call- but due to the ties our family share, I feel obligated to at least hear the man out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zksacramento;To Sacramento I must go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya25;I have arrived in the great city of Sacramento, and at the gates of the Celestial Palace. The emperor is waiting inside. A knot grows in my chest as I approach the great Redwood doors of the palace, and push them open. Sitting before me is none other than the Celestial Emperor himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkemperor;And now, I must hear his words...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ZKBEARPALACE;The Imperial Palace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya26;"Zakariyya of Socal, you have been brought before the Earthly Reflection of Heaven's Throne, to answer for the repercussions of your deeds. In the words of the Lawgiver, 'Our actions are are the structures of time, and all history grows wild around them.'\nIt is true that I, the Son of Heaven, sent the courtier who revealed the truth behind the Carmines and their treachery. I and my Temporal Council have spent a great deal of time to rectify the actions of my predecessors, who, in struggle against the Pleasure Dome, have threatened the Prime Mandate. As your forefather and mine once did, you stand on the precipice of an instance. Hear the words of your sovereign,- or damn us all. Of this I can no more convince you if you do not wish.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_zakariyya27;The Emperor slumps in his throne. His head hangs in his hands. "If this is your choice, I cannot persuade you otherwise. Know this: you are ensnared in the machinations of this world, and the evils that drive it. Call it Moloch or Shaitan, they will pour out bloodshed as the draught of your thirsts. May it be that the day comes, when you stand before your namesake in the world beyond, and answer to him why you denied his witness and Injunctions." \n The Emperor looks out the window, all pride and stature gone out of his face. The brilliant red and white of his robes seem faded, and the Bear crown looks less fearsome in the fading light. "Leave me. The night is falling, and the Dianet must rest with California for a time."\n Unthinking of it, you turn without a bow and leave. The Totally Righteous figurehead does not even comment on it, lost in the wheels of his mind.  At the threshold of the throneroom, you seal the redwood doors of the Empire behind you.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_zkonwards;Onwards...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya28;"What set apart Elton and Zakariyya was their ability to do what those who came before and after them could not: to break the cycles of violence and ambition. When Zakariyya won at San Francisco, it was only by loss that he could rise above the intoxications of power and look around him. He saw the nation he had built threatened by his actions, a brother he loved slain by pursuit of conquest. Pain forged him. In Three Days he gained the wisdom it would take the others three lifetimes to gain- he stepped aside and so, won. He found victory by the victorious struggle of a different sort: to set aside violence and subjugation, to take rule and law.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya29;"Others faced that moment too, but they could not turn aside. They ran forward like a man on fire, terrifying and brilliant, yet what drove them consumed them. Heartache and downfall were there legacies. Socal was Zakarriya's- and it lasted, more safe and secure than any other realm in all the Bear Land. The Supreme Heart of the Valley called himself the Anointed One, and he died with an arrow in his gut. Who still follows the Hubs, the Silics, or the Thoughtless Path? None. Who yet still follows the ways of the Imamites? A multitude.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya30;"Elton faced the same test. He earned his agonies early, and they purified him. Others would have taken Sacramento by arms, slain the Strutters, but not Elton. It was only because he had been with Blackedgers, and loved them like family that he knew what it was like to be at the other point of the knife, and drink the bottomless cup of retribution. When he put his life in Hardin Strutter's hands, he knew the words of your prophet, Jesus of Nazareth: What does it profit a man to gain the world but lose his soul- for what can a man sell his soul? Elton changed all of California when he was able to put a future for his people above his own ambitions. He had a victory of a higher, greater sort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya31;Now, here we stand. We are the children of our forefathers, and we must hope we have their wisdom. I have seen my dynasty's legacy wither to nothing, and you seethe with vengeance against those who butchered your father. You may ask yourself, "What has this man done for me? What did he do for my father?" And the truth is: little enough. I do not ask you to come here for me. I do not ask you to come here for yourself either.\n I have summoned you here for the good of California.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya32;"The other choice is one much more difficult. To surrender. To begin the long effort to reunite California, to stand beneath the bear Flag once again. It was this Empire that brought peace, and this Empire's fall that has engendered the ways of strife once again. And the Empire needs a strong hand such as yours to reverse this decline. The restitution of those things that have fallen into disrepair is a mode you have become well acquainted with in the last few years. It is only one who has been forged by suffering that can see beyond it, into the final frontier of the future. I ask you, Zakariyya, to take up this partnership as Musa did, though ever more tightly. I ask you to be my strong right hand as Hardin was to Elton. Only by admitting the need for each other can we achieve what is greater than ourselves.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_zakariyya33;In your mind's eye, you feel the weight of your soul and those who came before you fly around your thoughts. You think of the Carmines and  your butchered father, of figurehead Emperors and court intrigue. You think of the Prophet and the Lawgiver, of Zakariyya, Musa, and Annil. There are the dreams of independence for Socals and nightmares of a California in endless strife. You think of the precipice of the moment, of the choice between one's self and one's others. You think of Sacramento. Los Angeles. San Francisco. Pride, wisdom, love. Honor. Duty. At last, you can find only one course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya34;The Emperor does not even flinch when you draw your sword - though he does raise himself up when you kneel. Before the great throne of California, you bow. "I shall not pledge my loyalty to the Emperor again, your Grace, for it has never been truly lost. By the will of God, I shall lend my sword to you, and to the restitution of that which has long been neglected. As you serve California, so shall I serve you.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya35;[e_california.Holder.GetFirstName] says nothing at first, but he takes the Black and White ring from his finger, carved with the ancient Chinese symbols of Balance and Tau, and he puts it upon your own. In the evening torchlight he seems half man and half image, red and white robe blazing with color, Bear Crown practically come alive with the glinting gold. When he speaks, it is like an echo of centuries that come down, tying together the promises of your ancestors in new bonds.\n "With warriors such as you, the Greatest has granted us victory. I shall be like a fish who has discovered water when I am within your brave presence.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_zakariyya36;With the title of Anti-Governatus, and imperial favor. I have a new purpose in my heart, and with it, I will go forward and help the Emperor in building the California my ancestors have aspired to forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The battle was a swift triumph for the Lawgiver, as he seized the city with minimal resistance from its commonfolk. After several petitions from courtiers, the Emperor agreed to create a shrine for the martyred preacher. Revered by both Cetic and Imamite faithful, the holy site is devoted to the Lawgiver's grace and the perseverance of Gurus and Imams alike.\n Soon, I will be among them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajj4;To San Francisco we depart!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_HAJJNY;A Traditionalist Pilgrimage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajj5;A bustling metropolitan center revered by many faiths, the city of New York is a popular location for pilgrims of all creeds. The ancient House of Tradition fled Rust Cultist persecution in Detroit to the shelter of the Gothamite burghers, placing the city chief among traditionalist holy sites. It is there that the Mufti and all the great Scholars of Tradition reside, where they preside over constant dialogue on the nature of Islam. Scholars from all corners of the Americas visit this hall to discuss, and soon, you will be among them and the greatest minds of your faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajj5;May Manhattan well receive us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_HAJJTP;An Orientalist Pilgrimage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajj6;The holy city of Tampa is where it is said that the first Grand Sultan descended down from heaven on a flying carpet. Ever since that fated day lost to time, the Grand Sultans of the faith have resided inside the city's grandest temple. Any ruler of Orientalist creed would do well to visit his palace and heed his prophetic words, for he alone is the highest interpreter of the heavens. Before long, you too will be at his doorstep, hearing his words and awaiting his judgement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajj6;Praise be to Allah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hajj18;The wise man starts telling you, that the wise sheik Antoine Galland once said, narrating through the Prophet Ali Baba, may the Crescent Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "For a man's country or his stomach he might bid his life, even for his horse. Never, never for a woman.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_HAJJ20B;My soul yearns too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajj21;The wise man begins his narration, telling of the poem made by the Grand Sultan Harun al-Rashid, who lived in the time of Ali Baba, upon seeing a famed beauty:"I looked on her with longing eyne, And grew anew my old repine- For the gazelle, who captured me, Where the two lotus-trees incline...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hajj23;The wise man begins telling of the tale of the dervish who became King, and his interaction with the envious man who pined for his throne. "You see that this Sultan was not content with merely forgiving the envious man for the attempt on his life; he heaped rewards and riches upon him." ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hajj26;You have arrived in the city of San Francisco in all of its wonder. The marvelous hustle and bustle of the city is almost overwhelming, as men and women of every creed and color walk the streets around you.

EVTTITLE_HAJJSFARRIVED;The Shrine to Al-Karim;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajjsfshrine; You have spent quite some time in the city of Gold and Iron making talk with local aristocracy, and the time has come for you to fulfill the purpose of this pilgrimage. Dismounting a carriage, the hustle and bustle of the Bay seemed to give way to the tranquility of [e_california.Holder.GetFirstName]'s Grove. An old man in white robes greets you, his clothing the hallmark of a Cetic Guru. He bows respectfully. "Come," he beckons, as he leads me along a trail.\n Hidden behind the trees is the building I can only assume to be the shrine to al-Karim- its golden minarets shining in the sunlight. As I step through its hallowed doors, I enter the common praying area. All men are equal before God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjsfshrine1;I bow my head in prayer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajjsfhome;Walking back through the familiar gates of my castle, I can't help but feel fulfilled. I have travelled across the land, and returned a changed man. Before Allah, all men are indeed equal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hajj32;You have arrived in the city of New York, home of the House of Tradition. But spending time in the city has been quite eye-opening. Here there are men of all sorts of different creeds. In your inn, the theological talkings of a Jewish holy man and Christian burgher catches your ear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_hajjzealousny;If only they saw the only way to revere the Greatest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajj33;You have arrived in the city of New York, home of the House of Tradition. As you approach the great house of worship, a bookish merchant glances up from behind a small stand. "Traveller! Come forth and browse my wares, the finest the old-world can offer." ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_quranny;That Quran must be ancient! A wondrous addition to my collection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_qurannony;One does not need such frivolous relics to praise God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HAJJNYARRIVED;The House of Tradition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajj34;You did not know quite what to expect when setting off on this grand journey, but the house of Tradition was a bag of surprises indeed. It was no opulent mosque, yet scores of men clad in all sorts of garments surrounded you. Wandering through the structure, I found myself at the base of a grand table surrounded by dozens of scholars. The room falls into silence as I enter, only broken by the speech of the man at the head of the table. "You must be the [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]," he calls to me. "Tell me, how do the scholars of [Root.Capital.GetName] interpret the words of..."  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_hajjnyhome;There is one god but Allah, and Mohammad is his messenger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


EVTDESC_hajj37;The Grand Sultan's temple shines magnificently in the distance. The Bazaar surrounding you is nothing short of remarkable- the scents of spices and incense fill the air. An old man with a turban wrapped around his head approaches you, offering you a magnificent lamp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjlanternyes;I must have it!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_lanternno;I have no need for such frivolous goods...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajj38;In the streets of Tampa, you meet a peculiar man, with a serpent curled around his arms. He claims that his Gods protect him- and it would appear so, as no malevolence is shown in the snake. Could this man possibly be favored by the divine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjsnakehandling;Bring my flute- I must prove I, too, am favored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjsnakeno;What a peculiar man...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajj39;You raise your flute to the air and begin attempting to charm the snake with a tune. Unfortunately, it has been a while since you have practiced the art of Snake Charming, and the Serpent recoils from you, remaining perched on the mans arm. He glances at you with a pitiful look.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjsnakehumble;I will leave charming to the Genies...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjsnakeangry;Do not glance at me, Infidel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajj40;You raise your flute to the air and play nothing short of a masterful tune. The serpent slides down the mans leg, slithering up your leg as you play the orientalist hymn. The serpent slides up your body, before passively resting around your shoulders. "Remarkable!!" The man cries out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjsnakefriend;Come with me- you are welcome in my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjsnakeamazed;Through the Crescent, all is possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_HAJJTPARRIVED;The Grand Sultan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajj42;The Temple of the Grand Sultan is as magnificent as the stories of Arabian Nights, its many golden spires and ornate domes gleaming from across the land. As you enter through the front gates of the temple, soldiers of the Arabian Knights stand attentively on either side of me, their hands affixed to the scimitars at their waists. But the scores of soldiers were not the most magnificent feature of the temple- that honor would go to the brazier lit main hall, shrouded in an odd aura as the Grand Sultan himself sat perched above the room on a flying carpet. It takes time for the carpet to slowly descend, but when he reaches the floor, he touches my forehead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjgrandsultan;I have earned his favor!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajjtphome;Walking back through the familiar gates of my castle, I can't help but feel fulfilled. I have travelled across the land, and returned a changed man. Before Allah, all men are indeed equal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hajj50;You have arrived in Manhattan, but the House of Tradition is not of your concern. Your entourage makes its way for the harbor, where you will have to find a voyage to the Old World.

EVTDESC_piratemecca;"We're here, Milord!" One of the Corsairs calls to you. You are rapidly approaching a very small island, with no discerning features minus a few trees and a large black stone at its center. Wait... is this actually Mecca..? Mecca wasn't on an island...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_HAJJGIBRALTAR;The Port of Gibraltar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hajjgibraltar;Its been a long voyage from New York, and it has been full of obstacles. But at the sight of land, your stress evaporated. "Land ho!" A crew member calls out. Our ship steadily coasts into a large harbor at the foot of an enormous mountain, unlike anything seen in the New World.\n You pensively look out across the Harbor. Many ships of all sorts of queer design fill the harbor, as peculiar men wander the port harkening their wares. Odd, small primates wander where humans are spare, scavenging for whatever they could find. But the question remains- where will your journey continue from here? The expanse of the mediterranean and Sahara lays ahead of you- if any time was the time to turn around, it is now. But surely, with the great distance already travelled, it would all be for naught if you turned around now... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hajjmalaysia;Its been a long voyage from San Francisco, and it has been full of obstacles. But at the sight of the bustling port of Singapore, your stress evaporates. "Land ho!" A crew member calls out. Our ship steadily coasts into a large harbor at the shore of a massive city, unlike anything in the New World.\n You pensively look out across the Harbor. Many ships of all sorts of queer design fill the harbor, as peculiar men wander the port harkening their wares. But the question remains- where will your journey continue from here?

EVTOPT_hajjajmoney;A great bounty of wealth I haggled for with the local traders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hajj69;You are very far from home. Simply put, you have likely gone further than any adventurer in the history of post-Event North America. So it would come as no surprise that a longing for home has arisen. Perhaps you've seen enough already- maybe its time to head back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hajjgohome;Im lucky to be alive. This has been a grand voyage, but I'll head home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

secret_religious_society_qingzheng_desc_REAL;The Qingzhen have long faced persecution from all sides. To many of their fellow Muslims, they are overly-permissive, even heretic. To non-Muslims, they are infidels making half-hearted futile gestures at understanding and assimilation. But the Qingzhen are rightfully named, for they know they are the purest and truest followers of Allah. One day, the rest of the world will understand this too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

traditionalist;Traditionalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
traditionalist_DESC;The Traditionalist community are descendants of pre-Event lay Shi'a and Sunni Muslims. With the trauma of the Event putting the already persecuted religion in grave danger, many reached across sectarian lines, seeking to set aside minor differences in the name of preserving the faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
imamite;Imamite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
imamite_DESC;Refusing to abandon Shi'ism in the wake of the event, the Imamite faith clung onto their beliefs, isolating themselves from the Traditionalist community. Developing on a trajectory of their own, the Imamites continue to await the Twelfth Imam's coming, and the corresponding deliverance of freedom and justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
imamite_FEATURES;Y*! Imamite rulers may gain sympathy with Cetic by decision.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
revivalist;Revivalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
revivalist_DESC;Whilst much of the Ummah saw the Event as a test by God, the Revivalist sect saw it in a very different light. The Event was no test-- it was a reckoning, a punishment from God for the sins of society. Ostracized from the Traditionalist community, the Revivalists believed the only way to "revive" society and lift God's punishment was to cleanse sin and heresy from this world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orientalist;Orientalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orientalist_DESC;Once a society of nobles known as the Shriners, centuries of isolation and outside influence set the Orientalist faith on a path of its own. Orientalists try to incorporate the ancient rites of their order and legends from the old world into their religious practices, which many non-Orientalists decry as "distortions" in the faith. The Orientalist religious heirarchy answers to a high priest known as the Grand Sultan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orientalist_FEATURES;Y*! Orientalist rulers may gain access to the Mystic trait by decision.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
qingzheng;Qingzhen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
qingzheng_DESC;The Qingzhenren, literally meaning 'Pure True People', have existed since pre-event times. When Zakariyya briefly conquered San Fransisco, some within the Chino community in the city adopted his philosophy, leading to a reawakening of Qingzhen thought. They have historically been heavily repressed by the rulers in San Fransisco, though they found some reprieve under the Yudkow dynasty. Some non-Islamic theological influence comes from Confucian teachings, such as an emphasis on respecting Heaven's Mandate, as ordered by Allah, as well as reverence of saintly figures, which lead to others claiming that they are idolatrous in nature.  One standout belief is that polygamy, while permitted, is dissuaded. They are cosmopolitan like the mainstream Imamites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alawiyya;Alawiyya;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alawiyya_DESC;Rather than adopt the cosmopolitan attitude of the Imamites, the 'Alawiyya community adheres to a fundamentalist version of Imamite theology. Like the Imamites, they also highly respect the post-event figure of Zakariyya, but they emphasize his martial exploits rather than his diplomatic ones. The 'Alawiyya are thus more warlike than mainstream Imamites and reject cosmopolitanism out of hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
misrist;Misrist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x # needs to be like this for dynamic text to work correctly
misrist_DESC;Although Misrism descends from the same noble society as Orientalism, Misrists reject the mainstream Orientalist understanding of Islam. Instead, they believe that the 'Great Calamity' fell on the Americas because mankind deviated from the true Islamic message, which 'Amun-Allah' gave to the people of Earth through a series of African prophets. Misrists believe that rulers can be revered after death, and they often take traditional Egyptian names.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
