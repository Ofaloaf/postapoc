rustcult_salvage;Salvage Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rustcult_salvage_desc;The techpriests need a constant supply of salvaged Old World technology to continue their studies, and a lucky salvager might find himself wielding a powerful tech prize.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_describe;Salvage Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_describe;The people of the Old World left many amazing artifacts behind. Powerful weapons, tools that aid in all varieties of work, machinery our most brilliant Techpriests do not fully understand, and beautiful objects our finest artisans cannot replicate. Much of the Old World is gone, consumed by centuries of rust, but a few rare artifacts survive in workable condition...\n\nAcquiring such an artifact will not only bring me wealth and prestige, it is the sacred duty of all followers of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_describe;Hmmm, where will I find good salvage?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_choosesite;You check the maps, and have located several potential expedition sites in the province of [From.GetName]. The people of [From.GetName] follow the [From.Religion.GetName] faith, and are culturally [From.Culture.GetName].\n\nProvinces populated by infidels are more likely to contain items of the Old World, since they do not have the traditions of salvage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_choosesite_accept;That will be my destination.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_choosesite_reject;That province is unacceptable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_prepare;Before leaving on your Salvage Expedition to [From.GetName], it would be wise to make preparations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_prepare_start;Set out with your men.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_prepare_research;Consult the Techpriests for good salvage locations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_prepare_warband;Assemble a battle-hardened warband to accompany you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_prepare_envoys;Send envoys ahead to smooth your travels.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_unfriendly;Unfriendly Locals;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_unfriendly;You arrive in [From.GetName], and many of the local residents are distrustful or outright hostile towards you and your men. You notice them watching you surreptitiously and talking amongst themselves, and have a difficult time finding a place to rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_unfriendly_ignore;Ignore them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_unfriendly_warband;We're well armed, they won't risk attacking us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_unfriendly_envoys;My envoys have arranged for safe passage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_unfriendly_intrigue;Try to keep a low profile.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_provowner;Rust Cultists from a nearby realm are attempting to salvage Old World artifacts from your lands in [Root.GetName]. Their presence seems to be drawing the ire of the local [Root.Religion.GetName] population, who are preparing for a confrontation with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_provowner_violence;Let the locals drive them away.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_provowner_peaceful;We must avoid bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_peaceful;Mixed among the local residents in [From.GetName], you see the occasional soldier wearing the colors of [From.Holder.GetTitledFirstName]. Fortunately, the soldiers seem to be ensuring that order is maintained and the locals allow you to pass without conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_violence;Hostile Locals;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_violence;Your continued presence in [From.GetName] has drawn the ire of the local peasantry, and you are now confronted by a disorganized mob of angry villagers. They may not be well armed, and they're certainly not well trained...\n\n...but there are a lot of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_violence_flee;We should turn back.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_salvage_drivenout;Hordes of angry local villagers have driven you from their lands, ending your Salvage Expedition. If it makes you feel better, tell yourself you left to avoid shedding THEIR blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_agent;Competing Salvager;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_agent;During your expedition to [From.GetName], you encounter an agent of an unknown lord who shares your faith. He appears to be scouting new salvage sites for his master, in direct competition with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_agent;May the best salvager win!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_salvage_value;Salvage in [From.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_worthless;Your expedition has turned up very little valuable salvage. You have explored many ruined buildings, and everywhere you look you find the ruins picked clean.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_worthless;Disappointing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_worthless_compete;Someone has been here before me...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_worthless_research;There is another site nearby we could check.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_moderate;Your expedition has turned up a few items of useful salvage. In the ruined buildings and tunnels you have uncovered several artifacts of the Old World, though you have not yet found the kind of major prize you were hoping for.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_moderate;At least I found something.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_moderate_research;Hawk these trinkets, I know of another site.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe;Your men have discovered a large metal box beneath the ruins of a long-forgotten structure in [From.GetName]. The strongbox is corroded but still intact. Who knows what mysteries or treasures of the Old World are sealed within it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_safe;I'll know soon, crack it open!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_safe_patient;Have your tinker open it carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_item;Salvage;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_scraps;You have found scraps of Old World artifacts, but none of them are especially well preserved. There are objects that may have once been used for cooking or as craftsmen's tools, but it's hard to tell with the corrosion and decay of the centuries. They might be worth a few gold pieces to the right buyer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_coins;Your men have discovered a cache of corroded coins from the Old World. Their coins were inexplicably made out of base metals rather than gold or silver, dramatically reducing their value as working currency. Still, they might be worth a few gold pieces.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_glassware;You have discovered a long-hidden supply of Old World glassware. Unlike iron objects which have mostly been consumed by rust, many glass objects have survived. You need but wipe off the centuries and you'll have finely polished Old World artifacts that artisans today cannot replicate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_machinery;Amongst a wreck of disintegrated iron, you find a fabulously preserved piece of Old World machinery. Though stained with rust, the beautiful object itself does not seem to have rusted. It is about three feet across, irregularly shaped, with a half-dozen holes perfectly cut partway through it. It is constructed from a metal that is lighter than iron.\n\nThis will be a great addition to your great hall, or part of a shrine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_shades;You have found a long-abandoned pair of old-world glasses. Although they at first appear to be coated in dust, further inspection reveals that the glasses are tinted. Although the frame is somewhat rusted, the lenses themselves are in good condition. With some work, they could be used to create fully-functional and stylish shades.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_smash;Your men take to the box with hammers, and succeed in ripping the door off after a few hours. Whether it was the rough handling of the box, the ravages of time and moisture, or simple bad luck, you find nothing of value within.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_safe_jewellery;Treasures!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_jewellery;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a variety of Old World jewelery, glittering with gold, silver, and precious stones. The craftsmanship is finer and more intricate than what modern goldsmiths can produce.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_safe_ledger;Papers?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_ledger;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: several old folios bound with crumbling dark leather and stacks of identical green paper strips with the rune "20" in the corners. It's amazing how well the safe has preserved its contents, the seal must have been perfect. The folios are filled with line after line of numbers and symbols.\n\nYou would be rich, if paper currency were still in use.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_safe_ledger_amer;Ancient portraits of the Founders!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_safe_ledger_consumerist;Icons of the Almighty Dollar!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_safe_photos;Paintings?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_photos;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a collection of dozens of tiny paintings, discolored with age but extremely detailed. The paintings depict a family of people in the Old World. How these paintings were produced is a mystery to you, as the canvas is very thin and there are no visible brush strokes.\n\nThe cracked and crumbling condition of the paintings makes you think they are unlikely to last long after being removed from the sealed safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_musicbox;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a collection of small ornate boxes about the size of your palm. Each box contains a cylinder with patterns of tiny protrusions, adjacent to an array of metal tines of various lengths. You twist the small crank on the side of a box, it begins to plink out an Old World melody that probably hasn't been heard for centuries.\n\nThis will be a hit among my courtiers... a song for the ages!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_machinery;Machinery!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_electric;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a complicated piece of Old World technology, the purpose of which is a mystery to you. The artifact features several prominent finely blown glass bubbles, mechanical innards, and thin flexible metal strands that shed greenish-black powder when disturbed.\n\nYou are unable to get the artifact to do anything. There seems to be something missing that you don't understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_safe_firearm;Firepower!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_firearm;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a long metal tube with various bits of metal and brittle wood attached to it. You've heard stories that Old World knights used such devices to produce fire from nothing, but it's hard to believe you're seeing one for yourself.\n\nThough the safe has preserved it well, you will have to handle it gently and be unable to fix it if it breaks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_typewriter;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a well preserved piece of Old World technology with the word "Underwood" written on it in gleaming gold-leaf letters. Rows of thumbnail-sized metal disks are attached to the complicated mechanical innards of the machine, each labeled with a unique rune.\n\nAside from its beauty as a piece of recovered tech, this machine would probably be very useful if you could figure out how to use and maintain it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_calculator;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a well preserved piece of Old World technology with the word "Arithmometer" engraved in the metal in a flowing script. The machine is dominated by a heavy horizontal metal cylinder, with numerals visible through gaps in the metal shell and a hefty metal hand-crank on the side.\n\nAside from its beauty as a piece of tech art, this machine would probably be very useful if you could figure out how to use and maintain it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_watch;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a golden, palm-sized clamshell disk, attached to an intricate chain of gold. When you open the clamshell you see that one side is labelled with the numerals I through XII, and you realize that the artifact is an Old World timekeeping device.\n\nIt would be a stylish accessory for any lord, but it would be even more useful if you could understand its workings and restore its function.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_optics;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a segmented set of brass tubes with several curved internal mirrors and smoothly bulging disks of polished glass. The tools and knowledge to craft such a device have been lost, but you recognize it as an Old World version of today's spyglass.\n\nYou will be able to see things from a great distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_textbooks;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: several stacks of thick books. They have been sealed away from the ravages of the weather, but the centuries have still taken their toll on their brittle brown pages.\n\nWith luck, a scholar fluent in Old World languages will be able to extract useful information from the books before they crumble into dust.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_compass;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a small metal disc with a string attached to it. As you hold the item, you notice that there is a free-floating needle inside. You realize that the artifact is a hand-held Old World navigational device.\n\nOnce you learn how to properly calibrate and use it, it is unlikely that you will ever lose your way again.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME_salvage_result;Salvage Expedition ends;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_result_poor;Not all Salvage Expeditions end in success. Sometimes the recovered artifacts are badly damaged, sometimes they are worthless, sometimes there isn't anything to salvage because the area has been picked clean, and sometimes dangerous circumstances interrupt the expedition.\n\nThis is one of those times.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_result_poor;Until next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_result_medium;You have returned from your Salvage Expedition with baubles and artifacts of the Old World. Although you did not find a tech prize truly worthy of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]'s favor, at least you didn't return empty handed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_result_medium_keep;I'll keep the salvage for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_result_medium_sell;Someone will buy these trinkets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_result_medium_donate;I will donate these artifacts to the techpriests for study.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_result_good;You have returned from your Salvage Expedition with an exciting tech prize, worthy of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]'s favor. Your court is buzzing with word of your success, and the techpriests are already coming to you with requests to examine your prize. It remains to be seen whether you can return the artifact to a functional state.\n\nThis will surely bring you fame, power, and understanding of the old world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_result_study;I must study and repair my prize.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_repair_prize;The Past Restored;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_firearm;After weeks of study, your armorers have finally restored your Old World firearm to working condition! Much of the wood body had to be replaced, but the metal parts were functional. The charges required to operate the weapon are in extremely short supply, as many of those found alongside the weapon were dangerously unstable and your armorers do not yet know how to construct additional charges.\n\nYou will be a fearsome and inspiring figure on the battlefield!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_study_firearm;This is my boomstick!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_calculator;After weeks of study, your tinkers have finally restored your numeric calculating machine to working condition! You are still learning how to operate it: you enter numerals by sliding the levers into the correct positions, then turn the heavy crank and the machine produces the result of addition in mere seconds.\n\nThis will make it much easier to keep track of the rents and taxes that are owed to you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_watch;After weeks of study, your tinkers have finally restored your gilded timekeeping device to working condition! Once the device is activated by inserting a key and twisting it, it begins to emit a soft ticking sound and the slender arms move smoothly across its face. You must handle the artifact carefully, because many of its small parts are irreplaceable.\n\nYou will be aided in any tasks that require precise measurement of time!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_typewriter;After weeks of study, your tinkers have finally restored your lettering machine to working condition! Their fingertips are black from handling powdered charcoal and other attempts at creating a useful ink. Study of the device has revealed much about the prowess of Old World smiths.\n\nYou are now able to issue decrees in the neat, authoritative letters of Underwood himself!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_optics;After weeks of study, your tinkers have finally restored your brass spyglass to working condition! Polishing with a soft cloth has brought the shine back to the metal, while the glass optics have retained their nearly perfect transparency. When you look through the eyepiece you are able to see things at a distance others could only dream about, even gazing at the Moon and stars as the people of the Old World must have.\n\nThe potential military advantages are enormous!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_textbooks;After weeks of study, your scholars have learned many things about your collection of pre-calamity books. Several of the books have fallen to pieces during transport or study, but those that survived are providing valuable insight into medicine, engineering, and other topics.\n\nMore study will reveal additional secrets of the old world!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_compass;After weeks of study, your tinkers have finally restored your compass to working condition! The needle inside the compass has been recalibrated, and the quicksilver inside has been refillled. You are still figuring out exactly how to orient yourself with it, but you feel as if you're getting better at it over time.\n\nThis will make it nearly impossible for you to get lost on long journeys.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_study_compass;I shall never lose my way again!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_fail_prize;Unsolved Mysteries;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_fail;Despite weeks of effort you have failed to restore your salvaged prize to a useful state. Your assistants don't possess the knowledge or the tools to help you accomplish this task, and your efforts only seem to be causing additional damage. Major portions of the prize are damaged or missing, and there may be some mystical component required to make the device function that is not available to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_study_keep;I can still display it as art.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_study_sell;Someone will buy it from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TXT_bequeth_lost;The artifact is lost to the ages;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_firearm_battle;Take Aim!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_firearm_battle;An arrow glances off your armor as the battle is joined, the air fills with a flurry of battle cries, and you hear the ringing sound of steel on steel.\n\nYour foes surge towards you, but you raise your Old World firearm to single out a looming warrior leading the charge. You pull the trigger and the warrior is felled with a deafening blast of light and smoke, his armor useless.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_firearm_battle_default;Run from me, cowards!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_typewriter_history;Storytelling;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_typewriter_history;Sometimes you feel the urge to use your Old World typewriter to write things beyond the normal decrees, proclamations, and correspondence. Perhaps history will remember you more favorably if your thoughts on the events of the day are recorded in your own neatly machine-lettered words.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_typewriter_history_record;My dynasty will be remembered.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_typewriter_history_poet;I'll tell a rousing story.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_typewriter_history_square;I will use it only for affairs of state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_calculator_taxes;Death and Taxes;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_calculator_taxes;It may be boring, but it is a crucial task for any [Root.GetTitle] to ensure that [Root.GetPossPronoun] expected tax revenue matches the rents paid by [Root.GetPossPronoun] vassals. Your Old World Arithmometer has made it much easier for you to do just that. You feel much more confident calculating the expected contents of your treasury, and can ensure that the numbers reported by your advisers are accurate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_calculator_taxes_shrewd;This enhances my reputation for shrewdness.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_calculator_taxes_machine;I'm more machine than man!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_calculator_taxes_default;Some of my vassals are short a few coins.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_watch_smooth;Precision in All Things;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_watch_smooth;Since you acquired your Old World pocket watch, you feel like things have been running like... well, clockwork. You are able to bring precision and confidence to any issue you face. While others struggle with primitive sundials, you keep your stylish ticking companion with you at all times.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_watch_smooth_style;Plus, it goes with everything!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_watch_smooth_carriage;I make the carriages run on time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_watch_smooth_default;Well, I am pretty great.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_telescope_stargaze;Watch the Skies;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_telescope_stargaze;Sometimes you take your Old World telescope to a high tower late at night, and gaze through it at the sky. Some might consider it frivolous, but you find it relaxing to see the Moon and wandering stars in a way few have since the calamity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_telescope_stargaze_astro;I'll study the wandering stars, also known as planets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_telescope_stargaze_military;My telescope should be reserved for scouting.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_telescope_stargaze_calm;It's very calming.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_textbooks_medical;Intense Study;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_textbooks_medical;You have been spending some time studying your collection of Old World books. You are not fully fluent in the language, but you have determined that one of the books is a manual of Old World treatments for human disease. Though some of the words are arcane and confusing, there are many useful anatomical diagrams and descriptions of healing techniques.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_textbooks_medical_wound;This will help me heal my wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_textbooks_medical_ill;This will help me cure my illness.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_textbooks_medical_child;This will help me treat my sick children.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_textbooks_medical_lazy;Reading is boring.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_compass_navigate;Finding a Way;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_compass_navigate;Since you acquired your Old World compass, you have found that traveling has become much smoother. You almost never got lost, and you can safely find your way through paths that most would consider treacherous. You no longer have to struggle with crude maps or wait until nightfall to find your way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_compass_navigate_logistics;It is much easier to move trade goods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Huitzilopochtli requires a constant stream of human sacrifices to nourish him in his struggles against the forces of darkness that nearly destroyed him when he was the sun in the previous age. There are only a few who give their lives willingly to the gods, so you must seize captives with blade and dart.\n\nIn battle you wear a shimmering cloak of hummingbird feathers laid over golden cloth, and your face is painted pitch black.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_mictlan_incarnate_lifestyle;My lifestyle must change.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_mictlan_incarnate_traits;My habits must change.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_mictlan_incarnate_aligned;I truly embody the god.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mictlan_quetz;Quetzalcoatl Incarnate;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mictlan_quetz;As the human incarnation of Quetzalcoatl, you must embody the great feathered serpent's vast knowledge and just rule. Unlike many other Mictlantec gods, Quetzalcoatl does not demand endless human sacrifices. As the "Morning Star", you must wake early each morning to greet the dawn.\n\nYour ceremonial garments are crafted from the resplendent feathers of the quetzal bird, which shimmer with iridescent beauty in the sunlight.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mictlan_tezca;Tezcatlipoca Incarnate;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mictlan_tezca;As the human incarnation of Tezcatlipoca, you must be treated with the utmost respect and politeness. Those who anger Smoking Mirror are doomed to be destroyed with sorcery, their lives ending in chaos and strife. You rule the night, playing your enemies off each other with your skill in the art of divination.\n\nYour regalia includes a headdress adorned with heron feathers, a cloak crafted from a jaguar skin, and horizontal stripes of black and yellow across your face.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_mictlan_xipe;Xipe-Totec Incarnate;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mictlan_xipe;As the human incarnation of Xipe-Totec, you must maintain the cycle of death and rebirth. Just as maize sprang from the flayed skin of the Night Drinker many ages ago, you now coax a new living harvest from the dead Earth each year. The captives you sacrifice with arrows or gladiatorial combat provide succor to the Earth, ensuring that the cycle of renewal continues.\n\nYou wear the flayed skins of your sacrifices over golden armor, a terrible sight for your enemies to behold.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mictlantec_sacrifice;Sacrificial Ceremony;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mictlantec_sacrifice_desc;The gods require offerings of blood to sustain themselves. Should they receive insufficient sustenance, this age will end just as the last one did. Human blood is more potent than animal blood, and the blood of a king is more potent still.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mictlan_mortal_liege;Your weak mortal liege [Root.Liege.GetTitledName] brings shame to true followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.

EVTOPT_mictlan_mortal_liege_reject;War is not the answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mictlan_mortal_liege_notify;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has fabricated a claim upon your primary title.

EVTDESC_flavor_southernknight;You are a true Southern Knight, and must uphold a chivalrous code: never back down from a righteous fight, be polite even to your enemies, and show fortitude in the face of adversity.

EVTDESC_flavor_convenience;Recently you spent some time reading a crumbling old book, slowly interpreting the writings of the Old World. Within its pages, you find descriptions of the miracles that enhanced the lives of the people of the Old World.\n\nInvisible servants that carried spoken words hundreds of leagues in an instant? Even the swiftest pigeon takes hours or days.\n\nCould their carriages really have been pulled by over two hundred horses? Perhaps the writer was exaggerating.\n\nSummoning hot water on demand? That's a prospect anyone could get behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_flavor_baseball;Play Ball!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_flavor_baseball;Between the spring planting and the fall harvest, the idle farmers of a peaceful realm amuse themselves with games of sport.\n\nAs you pass a village in your demesne, a group of local farmers face off against a travelling band of sportsmen in the ancient game of strikeball. The teams take turns attempting to strike a thrown leather ball with a heavy wooden cudgel, allowing their men to seize territory around the perimeter of the field.\n\nA pleasurable way to pass the afternoon, even as a spectator... but a little wager might make it more interesting!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_flavor_amerdream;The American Dream;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_flavor_amerdream;At court, a discussion of the old philosophers wends its way to the topic of the American Dream. Many writers who lived before the calamity wrote on the topic, though few of their profound works survive today.\n\nYour courtiers all have their own unique opinions on the subject. As the discussion winds down, one of them asks for your view. Many eyes turn to you with eager anticipation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_flavor_amerdream_cynic;The dream is dashed... the old writers were fools.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_flavor_knowledge;The men of the Old World knew many secrets that were lost in the calamity. In the years since then, a society of scholars and philosophers in [Root.GetName] have gathered extant scraps of Old World knowledge for preservation and study. [Root.GetName] is a hub of commerce for geographic reasons, but these little-known archivists and intellectuals have quietly done their part to turn it into a cosmopolitan center of learning and culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_flavor_warfare;Ancient Warfare;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_flavor_warfare;There are many legends about the manner in which the people of the Old World waged war. It is common knowledge that they bargained with [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] to annihilate their foes from hundreds of miles away. Some claim that their champions penetrated the heavens on pillars of flame and smoke to steal celestial armaments. Others claim that they rode enormous clockwork tortoises into battle, crushing their foes under dozens of steel feet.\n\nIt is difficult to tell which of these tales are true, but what you know for sure is that a handful of the armaments of the Old World have survived. It would be good to wield that power... to feel the righteous wrath of the divine, warm in your hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In it lives a county boy who can play the guitar just like a ringing a bell. Many people come from miles around to hear him play his music while the sun goes down.\n\nIt would certainly be good if such a troubadour savant joined your court, entertaining your guests with the rich musical sounds of the Old World.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_overseas_arrive;Strange Ships;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_overseas_arrive;Reports from [From.County.GetName] speak of strange foreign ships arriving in the harbor. The ships fly unknown flags, and their design is unlike those of the local merchants.\n\nThe foreign ships are larger than normal galleys, and their sails and rigging appear to be in poor condition after a long voyage. They have anchored themselves a respectful distance from the docks, and the local authorities are requesting that you deal with the outsiders if and when they dispatch landing parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_overseas_audience;One of the foreigners steps forward and speaks in the archaic tongue of the Old World. Though his words are stilted and heavily accented, you can understand some of what he says and your court scholars are able to fill in the rest.\n\nThe spokesman explains that they are explorers and merchants, travelling far across the ocean to bring knowledge and wealth to their patron. Recent discoveries and court fashions have spurred a desire for certain goods that have been absent or scarce in their homeland for centuries. He claims you stand to be enriched as well by this lucrative trade. As you speak with him, the other foreigners occasionally converse quietly in a wholly unknown language.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Your shipwrights will learn new shipbuilding techniques from studying them, while a trove of maps and navigational tools will be useful to your cartographers and sailors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_overseas_friendly;Another Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_overseas_friendly;The foreigners are pleased with your decision, and present you with gifts of silver, colored glass, and smoothly carved white stone.\n\nThe foreign spokesman makes another offer in the words of the distant past: several of his men will remain behind in your court, to study the language and culture of your realm and perhaps teach your scholars their own language. This will ease future communication difficulties and solidify a profitable long-term trading partnership.\n\nYou catch disapproving looks from a few of the more zealous members of your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_overseas_return_bastard;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has returned from [From.GetPossPronoun] overseas mercantile adventure. In addition to valuable luxury goods, [From.GetSubjectPronoun] has returned with a bastard child.\n\nFrom the look in your [GetFromRelation]'s eyes, there must be a sad story behind the birth of the infant.

Numerous chests heavy with gold, spices, silks, and other exotic luxuries are unloaded from the ships.

EVTNAME_vision_war;Vision of War;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_war_die;An armored rider wheels towards you, a great plume of feathers on his cap. The air is thick with arrows, but the rider ignores them. Your arms are heavy, and the rider's spear finds your throat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_war_siege;You stand atop a high bluff, your banner crisp in the wind. Below you lies an ocean of men... soldiers beyond counting. In the distance, a great fortress burns.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_war_ride;Your horse is swift, and your arm is strong. A trumpet looses a mighty blast. You ride across the dusty ground with your companions, your hooves like rolling thunder.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_war_carnage;You stand in a bloody field, strewn with bodies. An injured soldier struggles to stand, using his weapon for support. Carrion birds circle overhead and a wolf howls to summon the pack.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_vision_wond;Vision of Wonder;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_wond_gather;A great fire roars in the center of the camp. Men and women from all tribes gather around it, embracing in fellowship with their faces smiling and shining in the firelight.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_vision_wond_field;You walk through a waist-high field of golden grass. The grass parts as you pass, rippling in the breeze like the surface of a lake. You raise your hand to shield your eyes from the Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_wond_kindle;Points of flickering orange light are kindled in the darkness. Soon, you cannot tell where the countless campfires end and the stars begin. You too must kindle a flame in the ashes of the old world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_wond_god;One of the powers of the universe draws close to you, within the sacred circle. You are laid bare before its piercing gaze, enveloped by a feeling of strength, compassion, and connectedness with all things.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_vision_wild;Vision of Nature;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_wild_sign;Three ravens lead you east, to the bank of the great sacred river. Three deer pass through the river valley. With them is a white fawn... a very great sign.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_wild_fly;Each step seems lighter than the last, as you bound higher. You need not touch the ground to continue, the warm thermals carrying you ever higher. The people below are no more than ants, the vast forest like a blanket of moss.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_wild_hunt;You observe your prey, carefully readying your bow. You scrape your hoof against the earth, filling your mouth with shoots and tender leaves. You feel both the bowstring against your fingertips, and the sharp bite of the arrow in your flank.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_wild_beast;A great beast watches you with glowing eyes, but you are not afraid. Its tongue lolls from its toothy mouth, and the beast almost seems to be smiling. Seemingly content, the beast departs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_wild_track;Curtains of sunlight wash over you as you move swiftly between the trees. A footprint here, a drop of blood there... you must be getting close. A moment later, you see your quarry.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_vision_doom;Vision of Disaster;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_doom_blood;The sky cracks like chapped skin and splits with a deep groan of pain. Bloody rain drips from the heavens. Sick men wander aimlessly in the gory mud below.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_doom_fire;Horsemen with flaming hooves rend the clouds with a clap of thunder and a burst of blinding light. Sheets of fire issue forth, scouring the land. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_vision_self_kids;Children laugh and play in a meadow of clover. The Sun is warm and the breeze is cool. Several of the children bear your face.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_self_luke;You swing your blade forcefully at your armored opponent, striking his neck. He is beheaded, and the strength of the blow knocks a shower of black lacquer chips loose from his armor. With a puff of smoke, your opponent's face is revealed to be yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_self_evil;There is a malevolent presence nearby. You feel like you are being watched, but you cannot see the watcher. You hear distant laughter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_self_sky;Across the ragged sky, you see a vast herd of black-horned cattle driven by doomed and ghostly riders. One gaunt face turns and looks past you, your misdeeds pooling in his mournful eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_vision_past;Vision of the Ancestors;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_past_rider;A silent rider passes you on the trail, carrying a horn of glowing embers. The night is cold, but you feel a warm sense of kinship with him. You are sure that there will be a fire waiting for you up ahead, somewhere in all that dark.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_past_light;You are in a vast city of the men of the Old World. Their homes are lit by a thousand thousand lanterns, stretching up into the sky. In comparison, the mightiest castle looks like a farmer's cottage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_past_heart;You see an old dead city, the great ancient manors stained with the years. The roads are filled with the men and women of the city, a vast river of humanity in constant motion. The city seems to pulse, beating like a man's heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_vision_past_arise;Deep beneath the roots of the mountains, you have lived for aeons. Now you emerge from the darkness, squinting and peeking through your fingers at the blinding light. Praise the Sun!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_vision_truth;Vision of Truth;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_vision_truth_illus;This world is an illusion. You are simply a dream of a god pretending to be real. You must unshackle your mind, free yourself from the mirage of this reality, and escape to the real.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_vision_ends;Vision Quest Ends;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_ends;Your spiritual journey is nearly at an end. You have experienced many visions, and though a spiritual guide is available to discuss the experience with you, only you can determine the true meaning of your vision quest.\n\nMany seekers take their experience to heart, reshaping themselves in accordance with their visions.

EVTNAME_vision_tbird;Thunderbird;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_tbird;The mighty Thunderbird is your totem! An enormous supernatural bird that causes thunderstorms with its wings when angered, the Thunderbird is associated with leadership and war.\n\nThunderbird is powerful, intelligent, and easily stirred to wrathfulness. With Thunderbird on your side, only a fool would dare to challenge you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_vision_totem_accept;My life path has been chosen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_vision_totem_guide;I will accept some guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_vision_totem_reject;My destiny is my own to choose.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_vision_ancestor;The Ancestors;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_ancestor;Your visions show you your ancestors, both distant and recent. A thread of fate runs through you, your father, and your grandfather... all the way to the inhabitants of the Old World.\n\nTheir experiences, memories, and skills will help you patiently face the challenges ahead. Perhaps one day, if [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] wills it, you shall do the same for your ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_vision_universe;The Universe;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_universe;Your visions have shown you deep truths about the nature of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] and the Universe. These insights will greatly aid you in your theological studies.\n\nSome might consider it ironic that as your knowledge and wisdom increase, your opinion about your significance in the grand scheme of the Universe diminishes. Those people are ignorant of the truths you have discovered today.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_vision_self;The Self;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_self;Many of your visions focused on yourself and your future. What kind of person will you become, and how can you live up to your potential? How can you improve your strengths, heal your spiritual wounds, and make the most of your life?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_vision_self_great;I will be great!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_vision_self_good;I will be good!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_vision_raven;Raven Totem;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_raven;The cunning Raven is your totem animal. Clever and opportunistic, Raven commands you take advantage of chaos where it arises.

EVTNAME_vision_wolf;Wolf Totem;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_wolf;The loyal Wolf is your totem. Wolf is a skilled warrior, but he knows that his strength is multiplied when aided by powerful allies.

EVTNAME_vision_coyote;Coyote Totem;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_coyote;The clever Coyote is your totem animal. A trickster and a thief, Coyote prefers to outwit his foes rather than fighting them directly. His lack of loyalty can prove problematic both for himself and those foolish enough to trust him.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_vision_madness;You have seen so many terrible things that your sanity is slipping away. Time seems to lose all meaning, and you feel as though your soul has been sharply separated from your body. \n\nWaves of terror, helplessness, and despair pass over you.

EVTOPT_vision_madness_givein;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] must desire madness!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_vision_nothing;Nothingness;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_nothing;In the end, your attempts to contact the spiritual world have come to naught. Others see visions of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] or hear soothing voices that guide them, but you have found only a terrible black void.\n\nRather than communing with the Universe, you are simply alone with your own thoughts. Does some barrier separate you from the divine, or is everyone else simply faking their connection?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_vision_nothing_facade;I must maintain a facade of pious spirituality.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_vision_nothing_madness;I can feel my mind slipping into madness...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_vision_cataclysm;Cataclysms Past and Future;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_cataclysm;You have seen many terrible things. To remember them makes [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] seem very far away, and you feel burdened by the knowledge of the trials you will face. It would be weakness to give in to despair, and you feel a weighty responsibility to grow strong that you might survive to be a shield in the darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_vision_cataclysm_labor;Tireless labor awaits me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_vision_cataclysm_prepare;If conflict looms, prepare for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_vision_cataclysm_cynic;Man must do what [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] cannot.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_vision_cataclysm_doomed;We're all doomed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_vision_doomed;DOOMED! DOOOOOMED!!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_vision_nature;The Natural World;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_nature;You feel the primal energies of the natural world flowing through you, and the distant presence of the divine. Your direct connection is not with [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] and the spiritual world, but with nature itself and the plants and animals that inhabit this world.

EVTNAME_apparition_vision;The Lady in White;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_apparition_vision;You see an apparition of a ghostly lady in white, so pure and holy that you feel your heart might burst. Though she says nothing, you instantly feel a deep connection with her and know with absolute certainty that she is the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nThe feeling is so powerful and fleeting that it's hard to believe you're not dreaming. Is there some remnant of her on the cloth she touched, or some essence of the divine lingering in her wake? Perhaps others should hear the tale of your experience... assuming, of course, that the thing you have witnessed stands the test of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_apparition_fakevision;The Apparition Scheme;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_apparition_fakevision;You've heard enough accounts of Marian Apparitions to know the story well: someone sees the Blessed Virgin, tells their tale, and is showered with wealth and fame. Even if you have not personally witnessed an appearance by [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], how hard could it be to construct just such a story? For a clever person like you, it seems like it should be easy.\n\nOf course, this kind of endeavor is not without its risks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_apparition_fakevision_scheme;This could be a lucrative scheme!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_apparition_fakevision_impious;No, it would be blasphemous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_apparition_fakevision_risky;No, it's too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

[relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] does not need to speak for you to recognize it, for it has all the necessary signs allowing you to readily identify it as Betsy Ross's American Flag.\n\nWith it, you will not only be an inspiration to the men under your command, but also to the Americanist world as a whole. Holding it in your hands, you feel the connection to the Founders, and you know that your men will fight like eagles wherever it is seen.\n\nAs draw your gaze away from it, you see your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] is still standing there, waiting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9619;[relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has finally returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, and has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a life-sized portrait. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] ensures me that it depicts an ancient President, and that therefore it is most prestigious to possess it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9620;[relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has finally returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, and has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a small iron box, containing a pair of curious-looking false teeth. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] informs me that they are the teeth of Washington himself, and that they were quite difficult to acquire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9622;The Platinum Chip;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9622;At long last, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has come home from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] quest to find a powerful artifact. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] reaches in [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] satchel and produces a small poker chip, which [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] hands to you.\n\n'This poker chip is composed entirely of platinum,' your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] says, 'and, if used in a game of chance, its owner shall never lose.' The significance of this find sinks in as you hold the chip and listen to your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle]'s words... If this chip truly is the Platinum Chip, then you will never again lose a gamble, whether that gamble involves coins, lives, or power...\n\nAfter a short while you realize [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] is still waiting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9623;Returning from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a remarkable find! It is a genuine treasury bond, issued by the Holy Mint itself long before the Event that struck down America! This small piece of paper has within it the power of thousands, nay, tens of thousands of holy dollars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9624;[relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has finally returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, and has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a codex full of coins. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] informs me that each of those coins are incredibly old and rare, and that this codex is therefore worth far more than one might assume at first glance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9625;The Divine Egg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9625;Having returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] artifact hunt, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] bears a large iron egg emblazoned with the holy trefoil.\n\n'This is a divine egg, laid by Atomos himself in the days before the apocalypse', your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] says as you inspect the beautiful object. 'It must be, for it matches all depictions we have of such eggs.' Not only will the Atomicist world now surely look up to you, but you can henceforth threaten your enemies with the power of Atomos himself!\n\nYour [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] waits as you gaze at the egg, clearly expecting a reward...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9626;The Demon Core;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9626;Having returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] artifact hunt, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] slowly and carefully carries a series of metal blocks stacked on top of each other. Trembling slightly, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] sets it down in a corner of the room before coming forward to speak with you.\n\n'That... that is the demon core.', your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] blurts out in fear. 'I know it is. I have seen it in action. I have met those affected by it. I... I apologize, but I had nothing else to bring...' Although the demon core is feared by Atomicists everywhere for its propensity to curse those it comes in contact with, you hope that you, at least, will remain safe form its effects.\n\n[relic_hunter.GetFirstName] stares at you, waiting for you to speak...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9827;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned, carrying with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a small box, within which lies an odd yellow substance. My [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] ensures me that this is an ancient isotope used by our forefathers to harness the power of the Atom!

EVTDESC_MNM_9628;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned, carrying with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a strange-looking device that emits a crackling sound. My [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] ensures me that this is a Geiger counter, used by our forefathers to detect the presence of the Holy Atom! This will surely aid me in my religious duties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9629;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned, carrying with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] an ordinary-looking pre-Event timekeeping device. However, my [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] assures me that this watch is imbued with the power of the Holy Atom, and is capable of emitting light in the dark. If true, this would be a highly useful item.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9630;Chest of Booty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9630;At long last, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has come home from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] quest to find some valuable booty. Carrying a large wooden chest, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] appears before you and offers it to you. 'Aaargh, my [Root.GetLordLady]. I have sailed across the seven seas, and have found you a bounty worthy of Neptune himself!'\n\nOpening the chest to sate your curiosity, you are blinded by the light coming from within, by riches beyond your wildest dreams. Properly protected from the elements, this chest has evaded discovery from greedy pirates for centuries... until now. Once news of this find spreads, you are sure that someone will compose a sea shanty about it.\n\nSeemingly expecting for you to speak, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] waits patiently before you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9631;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned, carrying with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a piece of parchment. My [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] ensures me that this is in fact an ancient map written by a long-dead pirate to mark the spot where he buried his treasure! If only you knew where it was telling you to go...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9632;[relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has returned from their long journey, bringing with them a carefully wrapped silver box.

EVTDESC_MNM_9633;[relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has finally returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, and has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a small glass reliquary. Inside, one can clearly see a single hair, which my [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] claims is a hair from the beard of Blackbeard, himself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9634;The Maltese Falcon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9634;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] returns from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] search, followed by two men who carry a heavy, ornate gold box, which they place on the floor before you. Bowing, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] proclaims: 'My search is concluded. I have brought home with me the Maltese Falcon  a gift from the Knight Templars to the Pope.'\n\nOpening the box, you find the Falcon wrapped in several layers of richly-decorated cloth. The Falcon itself is a beautiful statuette made of gold and studded with gems, sure to increase your standing in this world.\n\nPleased, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] waits for you to speak...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9635;The Sword of the Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9635;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned and brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a beautiful sword. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] has proof that it is one of Emperor Elton's swords, used in the conquest of Socal!\nNot only is it a finely-crafted blade, but it should also make men more eager to follow me in battle.\nSmiling as [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] sees the realization of the sword's significance creep onto your face, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] waits patiently for you to speak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9636;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned, carrying with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a finely-crafted idol. My [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] informs me that this idol depicts the deity America Kokudo Kunitama-no-Kami, the holy protector of the North American continent! This will surely improve my standing throughout the Pacific coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9637;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned, carrying with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a small ruby slipper. My [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] doesn't even bother to speak - the item needs no introduction. It is one of the famed Ruby Slippers, capable of supernaturally transporting its owner to wherever their home is! This will surely improve my standing throughout the Empire of California.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9638;The Heart of the Oasis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9810;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned, bearing a bizarre-looking object. Holding it delicately, and clearly treating the artifact with devout respect, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] hands it to you. 'I have found you the Heart of the Oasis, capable of healing any injury and curing any illness.'\n\nIndeed, once you hold it is not hard to recognize it for the remarkable object that it is. Created by Gaia Herself during her first Reckoning, she who holds it is sure to have her favor!\n\nSmiling as [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] sees the realization of the artifact's potential energy creep onto your face, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] waits patiently for you to speak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9639;The Core of Methuselah;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9639;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned, bearing an ordinary-looking piece of wood. Holding it delicately, and clearly treating the simple object with devout respect, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] hands it to you. 'I have found you the core of Methuselah, the oldest living thing on Gaia's green earth.'\n\nIndeed, once you hold it is clear that this piece of wood is anything but ordinary. Surviving Gaia's Reckoning by her grace, the tree Methuselah was the oldest living thing on the planet even before the Event!\n\nSmiling as [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] sees the realization of the object's ancient history creep onto your face, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] waits patiently for you to speak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9640;Returning from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] an intriguing piece of clothing. My [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] gives me a seemingly-ordinary crown of flowers, which [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] claims has lasted for ages and has never so much as wilted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9641;Returning from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a small, ornate metal box. Within it lies an old piece of wood with strange markings etched on it... Surely this must be the core an an ancient redwood tree!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9642;Returning from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a strange crystal that shines with divine energy. You feel calmer and more tranquil just by looking at it... surely this must be a powerful healing crystal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9643;Sitting Bull's Rifle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9643;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned and brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] what can only be a pre-Event rifle.\n[relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] has proof that it once belonged to Sitting Bull himself, and that it was used during the Lakota nation's first war against the Americanists! Not only is it a precision-crafted firearm, it should also make men far more eager to follow me in battle.\nSmiling as [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] sees the realization of the rifle's firepower creep onto your face, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] waits patiently for you to speak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9644;The Skull of Geronimo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9644;Having returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] artifact hunt, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] slowly and carefully carries a metal box towards. Bowing, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] carefully opens it before you.\n\n'This is the skull of Geronimo, taken by Americans in the days before the Event', your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] states proudly. 'I was presented with undeniable proof of that fact when I found it.' Although it would normally be considered incredibly disrespectful to carry a person's skull like this, the facts behind its disappearance mean that this skull has a special significance to its rightful owners.\n\n[relic_hunter.GetFirstName] stares at you, waiting for you to speak...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9645;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned, carrying with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] an ornate eagle feather headdress. My [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] ensures me that this was crafted by an ancient warrior in the days before the Event. This will surely improve my standing in the Native world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9646;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned, carrying with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a small box, within which lies a medicine cord. My [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] ensures me that this was crafted by an ancient medicine man in the days before the Event. This will surely improve my standing in the Native world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9647;Montezuma's Headdress;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9647;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned and brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] an incredibly ancient and ornate headdress.\n[relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] has proof that it once belonged to Montezuma himself, and that it was on the Emperor's head when he was first captured by the dreaded conquistadors! Not only is it a finely-crafted piece of headgear, it should also make men far more eager to follow me in battle.\nSmiling as [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] sees the realization of the rifle's firepower creep onto your face, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] waits patiently for you to speak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9648;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned, carrying with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a bizarre-looking skull made of crystal. My [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] ensures me that this skull is made entirely of a single piece of crystal, and that it once belonged to a god. This will surely improve my standing in Mesoamerica.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9649;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned, carrying with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] an ancient codex. My [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] ensures me that this was created by the ancestors of the Nahua people long before the colonizers arrived in Mexico. This will surely improve my standing in Mesoamerica.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9621[relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has finally returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, and has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a codex full of small pictures. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] informs me that this codex was called a "stamp collection" by its previous owner, and that each picture depicts an Americanist icon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_canada_15;I will go to Ottawa, the Old Capital of Canada.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_canada_15;I am longing to go on pilgrimage to Canterbury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_canada_20;My things are packed, everything is in order. I am ready to make my way to the Shrine of Our Lady of Prompt Succor.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_canada_21;Ottawa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_canada_21;You have finally arrived in Ottawa! Situated on the border between Francophone and Anglophone Canada, the city prides itself on its ancient heritage, having once been the capital of a united Canada. As you walk down the street, hearing both Quebecois and Ontarian words in the air, you begin to imagine what it must have been like to live in that ancient Empire. You plan to visit the Shrine to the Unknown Solider, a site revered by all Canadians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_canada_21;O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_canada_22;Canterbury;Cantorbry;Canterbury;;Canterbury;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_canada_22;You have finally arrived at Canterbury! It is beautifully situated between the St. John and St. Croix rivers in New Brunswick. The town itself and the surrounding woods are full of pilgrims from all over Canada. You had quite an eventful journey, meeting many strange pilgrims and hearing many strange stories, but you have finally checked into an inn near your destination. You are eager to finally see the Cathedral, one of the few great post-Event works of architecture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_canada_22;I am full of devout homage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_canada_23;Quebec City;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_canada_23;You have finally arrived in Quebec City! As Cap-Diamant comes into view, you marvel at the ancient fortifications that surround it. Quebec was the first ever capital of Canada, and it was renewed and restored by the great Queen Veronique. You have not sorted out your accommodations yet, but you will try to get a room in the ancient Chteau Frontenac. Besides the Notre Dame Cathedral, the old Citadelle is a popular site for pilgrims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_canada_23;I shall put God's gifts to good use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_canada_24;Detroit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_canada_24;You have finally arrived in Detroit! Although the city has a horrible reputation, you have found that it is not quite as bad as many say. The great factories that surround the city are hotbeds for paganism, yes, but the Church of Ste. Anne de Dtroit is quite beautiful. The city's culture is unlike anything that can be found across the strait in Canada - people of all colors and creeds walk the streets as equals, and the you can almost always hear strange music from somewhere in the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_canada_24;It has truly risen from the ashes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_canada_25;New Orleans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_canada_25;You have finally arrived in New Orleans! Although the journey down the Mississippi River was long and grueling, it has been well worth it. The ancient French Quarter lives up to its reputation, and the Mardi Gras celebrations are unlike anything you have ever seen. You must visit Our Lady of Prompt Succor, as her intercession prevented New Orleans from falling into the hands of Perfidious Albion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_canada_25;It is truly a unique city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_fallingstar_5;Panama City;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_fallingstar_5;You have finally arrived at Panama! Situated at the narrowest point between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, Panama has long been a center of trade, and you can hear conversations in unknown tongues in almost any part of the city. Although not many truly Christian churches remain in the city, the golden altar at the Church of St. Joseph is still a sight to behold. Saved from a siege by the Brethren long before the Event, the golden altar still stands at St. Joseph's Church, a testament to the endurance of Christianity in uncertain times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_fallingstar_5;Panama! There is nothing like it!;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_fallingstar_6;San Salvador;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_fallingstar_6;You have finally arrived at San Salvador! San Salvador has always been a place where diverse faiths coexist, and this has only become more true since deluge. It contains not only the largest remaining Christian church in central America, but also prominent shrines to the Cult of Saints and the old Mesoamerican gods. As you see practicioners of all these faiths intermingle peacefully, you marvel at the sight. Still, you have come here on a holy pilgrimage, so you would be remiss to dwell on this too long. Iglesia Cristiana Josue awaits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_fallingstar_6;Truly, a capital of culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_fallingstar_7;Belize;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_fallingstar_7;You have finally arrived at Belize! Like the Miskito Coast, Belize was once a possession of the ancient Crown, and as such holds a special significance to the Falling Star faith. The ancient Cathedral of St. John is one of the most important sites outside of the Miskito coast itself, as it was the cathedral in which many of the old Kings of Miskito were coronated. As you walk down the street, you can hear a tongue that is at once alien and distinctly familiar... truly, Belize is an incredibly holy place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_fallingstar_7;Truly, the land of the free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_fallingstar_8;San Salvador, what a fascinating place! A holy place for many religions, the city and surrounding area are full of monuments giving tribute to both Jesus and the Mesoamerican gods. Somehow when you look closer, they don't seem all that different. It really makes you think, doesn't it?;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_fallingstar_8;The Mesoamerican religions are most fascinating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_fallingstar_8;The Cult of Saints reveres Jesus too, does it not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_faculty_150;While trying to run some Ivy League-related errands, you come across two undergraduates arguing loudly about something. Before you get the chance to hear what the argument is about, one of the students throws a punch at the other, and the argument turns into a fistfight. As a distinguished Ivy League scholar, you should probably intervene, but perhaps it is better to let them work things out themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_faculty_150;Beat some sense into them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_faculty_150;They will respect my authority!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_faculty_150;Talk some sense into them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_faculty_150;Let them fight...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_faculty_141;Hello, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nAs you know, the Ivy League is not free. Although we do our best to make sure that our members are equipped with the best resources and equipment possible, we cannot do this for free. All members of the Ivy League are expected to donate a portion of their personal treasury to the League if able. If you have the funds, now would be a good time to donate. The envoy will arrive in around half a year.\nIn the name of Science!\nSigned, [hermetic_collaborator.GetSocietyRank] [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_faculty_142;The time has come for me to donate to the Ivy League. [FromFrom.GetBestName] has arrived at my court, and has asked me to donate part of my treasury, as I promised to do some time ago..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_faculty_142;Here is the money. Now go, in the name of Science!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_faculty_142;I changed my mind. They won't get a single ducat from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_faculty_161;Hello, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nAs you know, the Ivy League maintains many libraries across the world, so that the knowledge of the past may be preserved faithfully. However, one of our libraries has come into disrepair. As a member of the Ivy League, it is your duty to restore this library so that it may live up to our standards and serve as a beacon of light and knowledge.\nIn the name of Science!\nSigned, [hermetic_collaborator.GetSocietyRank] [hermetic_collaborator.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_faculty_162;The library is in dire need of books. Many older tomes have fallen apart, and more recent titles are missing altogether.\nThe question is, where to get them? And more importantly, how much will it cost me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_faculty_162;Science requires sacrifices, only the best will do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_faculty_162;Something from the bargain bin perhaps?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_faculty_162;I know every book peddler in town.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_faculty_162;This is hopeless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_faculty_163;Books don't go well with moisture, and the same could be said of older scholars. I need to make sure that the library's roof is impregnable! \nAlso, the latrines need attention. Badly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_faculty_163;We will need a metal roof! And a Franklin rod! And a brand-new latrine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_faculty_163;A proper stone roof will do. The latrine needs cleaning, though...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_faculty_163;I bet that some undergraduates would be willing to do this for free...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_faculty_163;This is pointless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_faculty_164;Relics from the pre-Event world surface from time to time. Including old printing presses. The Ivy League even has few of them in its vaults, but none of them are functional... \nWith lots of experimentation, and money, I could restore one to working order!\nOf course, I will have to replace some components that no longer exist with suitable alternatives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_faculty_164;A beast of brass, steel and type metal, powered by water-wheel and spitting pages... I can rebuild it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_faculty_164;I will have to pull some strings to get the money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_faculty_164;It's too risky, not to mention expensive. We should just stick with scribes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_faculty_165;Finally the library stands. And awaits judgment of the faculty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_faculty_165;They are amazed. Some even call me a genius!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_faculty_165;They are grateful, and congratulate me on a job well done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_faculty_165;They are disappointed, and some even want to expel me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_candomble_4;You have searched far and wide, but none of the Orixs suit you. Perhaps you should reconsider your choices...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_candomble_4;I will go back to the start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_candomble_4;I shall look in the middle again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_candomble_4;Maybe one of the last ones will suit me after all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_candomble_4;I can't seem to decide. Maybe now isn't the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_candomble_8;I will strive to be patient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_candomble_9;You find yourself drawn to the pleasures of the flesh more and more recently, and your loins are ablaze with passion. Perhaps Pomba Gira is guiding you down this path...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_candomble_9;I will not abstain from these pleasures!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_candomble_10;You have begun looking at members of the same sex in a different light recently. You realize that you have always felt this way, and that Pomba Gira is simply giving you the will to acknowledge it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_candomble_10;Thank you, Pomba Gira!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_candomble_11;You have become more and more focused on matters of faith recently, and you find yourself becoming more and more passionate in your beliefs. Perhaps Orunmil is guiding you down this path...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_candomble_11;Praise the Orixs! Praise Orunmil!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_candomble_12;Recently, you feel as though your conscience has become stronger and stronger. Your courtiers have begun to praise you for your just decision-making. Perhaps Orunmil is guiding you down this path...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_candomble_12;I will strive to be a righteous ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_candomble_13;Recently, you have found yourself feeling more and more proud of your position and accomplishments. Why should a ruler as great as yourself not feel this way? Perhaps Xang is influencing you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_candomble_13;I am a great ruler - why should I deny it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_candomble_14;A change has come over you recently. You now find yourself more and more willing to take punitive measures against those who have displeased you. In fact, you are beginning to enjoy these acts. Perhaps Xang is influencing you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_candomble_14;It is better to be feared than loved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
