landmark_angel_falls;§YSalto Ángel§!\n§YAngel Falls§!\nLocals claim with unusual certainty that this is the highest waterfall in the entire world. Originating from the heights of Auyán-Tepui, the stream dissolves into mist long before hitting the ground and forming a series of cataracts and smaller waterfalls. Any supporters of rival waterfalls would be forced to admit defeat upon witnessing it, as it is truly, undeniably, very tall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_arch_cabo_san_lucas;§YEl Arco de Cabo San Lucas§!\n§YArch of Cabo San Lucas§!\nAt Land's End, Baja California terminates in a cluster of rocky outcrops and islands. The natural stone arch resting at the water's edge is a popular site for pilgrims and vagabonds to visit, at least when the tide is out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_arch_st_louis;§YArch of St. Louis§!\nThis vast steel archway dominates the sky over St. Louis, leaping up to meet the sun in all its faded, rusty glory. Enthusiastic discussion of when it will finally collapse has not dissuaded a thriving marketplace from growing up under it and along the Mississippi riverfront.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_bermuda_triangle;§YBermuda Triangle§!\nAs with all traditions nautical, the Bermuda Triangle is as much superstition as practical knowledge. The waters between Bermuda, Puerto Rico and the Bahamas has the reputation of being unusually hostile to sailors, swallowing whole everything from fishing boats to grand flotillas. Sailing the open ocean is not a particularly wise choice at the best of times, but the reputation of the Triangle is enough to ensure that all but the most foolish captains follow the coastline whenever possible, and keep the voyage between Bermuda and the mainland as straight and simple as possible, lest they become lost forever in the deep blue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_cactus_curtain;§YCactus Curtain§!\nDespite the name, cacti are not particularly common in this area. It is assumed to be a reference to the unusually old and robust fortifications ringing Guantanamo Bay, dating back to before the Fall. Cuban scholars continue to speculate on why Guantanamo Bay was so heavily contested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_cano_cristales;§YCaño Cristales§!\n§YCrystal Channel§!\nThis river possesses a truly unique appearance - the 'Liquid Rainbow' is variously red, yellow, green, blue, and black. Scholars and theologians continue to debate the significance of the river, but all can agree it is very pretty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_catatumbo_lightning;§YRelámpago del Catatumbo§!\n§YCatatumbo Lightning§!\nThe mouth of the Catatumbo River is the source of nearly nightly lightning storms, rightfully giving Zulia the reputation as a land of storms and fury. It is said that should the storms ever stop for good, it is a sign that the world is once again about to fall into chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_cave_swallows;§YSótano de las Golondrinas§!\n§YCave of Swallows§!\nIn the hills south of Ciudad Valles is this immense open pit, populated by all manner of colorful birds. At dawn they spiral up into the sky, and at sunset they circle the mouth before diving in. Oddly enough, there aren't any swallows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_cheyenne_mountain;§YCheyenne Mountain§!\nIn the foothills above Colorado Springs, the mighty Cheyenne Mountain watches over the high plains. Despite the excellent defensive position the mountains have never been built upon. Local rulers claim it is simply too expensive and difficult to construct anything worthwhile there, but the peasantry maintain that the whole upland region is cursed in some way. The mountainside is near-devoid of vegetation year-round, and bold hunters and bandits that explore the area have an uncanny habit of disappearing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_chicago_canal;§YChicago Canal§!\nIn a peculiar twist of natural geography, the tributaries of the Mississippi lie only a short distance from that of the Great Lakes. Our forefathers evidently took it upon themselves to take advantage of this and transform it into a boon, and so the Chicago Canal was engineered through artifice and wisdom. Though it requires significant ongoing investment in dredging and operating locks, the profits gained from shipping between two great waterways more than outweighs the costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_chichen_itza;§YChichén Itzá§!\nOne of the ancient mythical cities of the Yucatan, Chichén Itzá remains inhabited and lively to this day. The Temple of Kukulcan lies nearby, providing water and a convenient gateway to the underworld for sacrifices of treasure and flesh. Though empires and civilizations may rise and fall, the stones of Chichén Itzá will outlast them all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_cn_tower;§YCN Tower§!\nIn the middle of old Toronto, the splintered remains of a great steel and concrete spire rises above even the tallest castle turrets and church belltowers. Why it was built none can say, but Toronto must have been the center of a great empire to be worthy of such an impressive monument.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_coffee_triangle;§YTriángulo del Café§!\n§YCoffee Triangle§!\nThe lands around Risaralda are famous for the production of high-quality coffee beans. The cool, wet valley climate provides the perfect growing conditions, and the local farmers use all their accumulated wisdom and skill to get the best possible yields. Truly Colombia is the land of coffee!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_columbia_icefield;§YColumbia Icefield§!\nIn the remote Canadian wilderness, the icefields of the Rockies lie sleeping between raw, jagged peaks. If one should brave the dark forests and cutting storms, one can discover a land made wholly of great sheets of ice and snow locked in position since ages unknown, holding the sky overhead with great pillars formed from frozen rivers and upthrust rock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_copper_canyon;§YBarrancas del Cobre§!\n§YCopper Canyon§!\nThis family of six canyons cut through the Sierra Madre Occidental, eventually forming the Rio Fuerte and reaching the Pacific Ocean. The stark beauty of the landscape is accentuated by the green lichens that grow along the sides of the canyons and give them the appearance of copper. Many towns have been built in precarious positions at the bottom and along the edge of the cliffs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_crazy_horse;§YCrazy Horse Memorial§!\nCarved into Thunderhead Mountain is the visage of the legendary Lakota leader and warrior Crazy Horse, who won such fame in combat that he is still reputed for his prowess. Such was the magnitude of his defeat of General Custer, it too was immortalized in the nearby lands so that no man may think himself above defeat.\n\n"My lands are where my dead lie buried.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_darien_gap;§YTapón del Darién§!\n§YDarién Gap§!\nThis region between Panamá and Chocó is unusual in its resistance to modern development. The swamps, forests and rivers seemingly unite to keep roads muddy, villages disconnected and trade at a crawl. While this isn't terribly concerning for the locals, administering this area is something of a nightmare for feudal overlords seeking to improve their demense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_dos_ojos;§YDos Ojos§!\n§YTwo Eyes§!\nThis immense underground cave system is marked by the two large cenotes resembling eyes. The true depths of these caves are unknown as they are flooded with seawater, but they are surely very deep indeed. Most popular guesses are that they lead to the underworld, vast treasures, or a sleeping monster that will one day awaken and destroy the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_erie_canal;§YErie Canal§!\nThis peculiar series of canals, locks and portages dates back to before the Fall. This waterway runs from near the base of Niagara Falls, across Hudsonia, through Oneida Lake, and finally meeting the Mohawk River. Though tedious and expensive to maintain, the advantage of a direct link between the Great Lakes and New York is enough to ensure it stays operational no matter the circumstances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_golden_gate_bridge;§YGolden Gate Bridge§!\nThe great stumps of a colossal bridge flank the mouth of San Francisco Bay, eternal sentries watching the gateway to California. Huge pieces of archaic steelwork and other, stranger objects are sometimes dredged up from the depths, inflaming the imaginations of people as they attempt to guess at what it must have resembled when whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_grand_canyon;§YGrand Canyon§!\nSurely the greatest of all, the Grand Canyon is like an immense furrow cut into the earth by a divine plow. To stand on the precipice and feel the gulf of distance to the other side can be likened to nothing else on Earth. To date, all attempts to bridge it have failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_grand_mesa;§YGrand Mesa§!\nThe immense Grand Mesa sits above the nearby hills and mountains like a castle above a village. Despite the hot, dry lands around it, the Mesa itself is rife with small lakes and large forests, making it something of an oasis in the inhospitable mid-west mountains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_great_salt_lake;§YGreat Salt Lake§!\nThis immense inland sea might not be potable, but gathering up salt for trade more than makes up for the lack. The lake is dotted with mysterious ancient ruins and formations, ranging from submerged villages to sunken ships, and even stranger occultisms such as the Spiral Jetty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_hollywood_hills;§YHollywood Hills§!\nThese dry hills overlooking Los Angeles have long been the playground of the idle rich. Airy manors keep the lords cool in summer, and generational horticulturalists compete to see who can gather the most impressive harvests from the orchards and vineyards spread across the hillsides. Hidden away in these elite holdings one can find some of the most extensive collections of fine art and antique relics, while the extravagent theatre plays and raucous parties are the talk of the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_hoover_dam;§YHoover Dam§!\nOn closer inspection this enormous waterfall is actually an artificial dam. What masters of creation were pre-Fall Americans, to leave such incredible works behind? Despite the fierce desert around it, the silted-up waters provide generous irrigation and aquaculture to those who live on the shores.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_lady_liberty;§YLady Liberty§!\nThe great copperwork statue sometimes known as 'The New Colossus' towers over the waters between New York, New Jersey and Brooklyn, a testament to the solid engineering practice and naval tradition common to the Atlantic realms. Lady Liberty helps to warn vessels at night with her eternally-burning torch, while during the day great polished mirrors reflect the sun across the horizon. Gothamites often say 'As sure as Lady Liberty', referring to the longevity of the stone and metal guardian watching over them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_lake_guatavita;§YLaguna de Guatavita§!\n§YLake Guatavita§!\nLong possessed of spiritual significance to the Muisca and other inhabitants of Colombia, Lake Guatavita is persistently been rumored to be the location of the legendary El Dorado. Whether man, temple or city, the lure of gold has drawn countless treasure-hunters to the lake. Diving, dredging and draining the lake have proven unsuccessful at discovering fabulous riches, but the occasional coin or trinket continues to surface and draw in a new wave of hopeful fortune seekers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_lake_texcoco;§YLago de Texcoco§!\n§YLake Texcoco§!\nWhile the broad Mexico Valley is considered the cradle of civilization in the kingdom of Mexico, it is the calm Lake Texcoco within it that truly deserves credit. Surrounded by jungle and mountains, Lake Texcoco fills the valley basin and provides all the fishing, irrigation and defensibility a righteous lord could demand. Mexico City itself sits on a series of natural and artificial islands in the middle of the lake, connected to the mainland by a number of causeways. The shore of the lake is crowded with many other great, but lesser cities whose history is almost, but not quite as great as Mexico. Together they form the heart of Mexico as a nation and as a people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_mississippi_river_delta;§YMississippi River Delta§!\nThe broad, flat lands and waters meet and intermix at the mouth of the Mississippi. Though New Orleans is renowned as a major trade hub and center of culture, the regular storms, floods and hurricanes make living here a challenge. The coastline, delta and the river itself are constantly shifting, submerging houses or leaving docks high and dry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_mt_st_helens;§YMt. St. Helens§!\nThough there are many notable mountains in the Pacific ranges, Mt. St. Helens holds particular notoriety. Aside from the semi-regular explosions of ash and fire, the locals insist that long ago during the Fall the mountain was consumed in a great explosion, utterly destroying itself and the lands all about it. Since then it has slowly grown back its height and splendour, preparing to bring ruination once again. Skeptics wonder at how if it killed all the witnesses who saw it, how did the story get told?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_niagara_falls;§YNiagara Falls§!\nThe largest and most famous waterfalls in all the Americas, pilgrims travel from across the land to witness the sheer magnitude of the natural wonder. There is a steady stream of ambitious or mad adventurers who attempt to ride the waterfall from top to bottom, by barrel, boat or bravado. Few return to the top for a second try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_nicaragua_portage;§YNicaragua Portage§!\nA less famous route than the Panama portage, traders still often choose to take their business through Nicaragua. From the Caribbean, shallow draft boats carry goods up El Desaguado, across Lake Nicaragua, and offload at Rivas for a short trip overland to the Pacific coast. There is a persistent rumour that proper canals will be dug out so the entire journey can be done by water, but it seems unlikely that it could ever be done with modern technology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_panama_canal;§YPanama Canal§!\nThe monolithic remnants of these vast locks and canals have long puzzled and awed those who see them. It is undeniable that easy travel from one ocean to another would be a boon to trade, but how was it possibly constructed and operated? How large were the vessels that plied it? Whatever the historical truth, the present use is far more mundane. The remaining structure of the canal system has been worked into a series of castles and fortifications, with trade goods carried overland the 'old-fashioned way.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_pantheon_venezuela;§YPanteón Nacional de Venezuela§!\n§YNational Pantheon of Venezuela§!\nVenezuela has always venerated its heroes, and the Pantheon is nothing less than a monument to devotion of those who came before. These hallowed halls contain the mortal remains of countless fallen figures, many of them soldiers but also including writers, artists and doctors. In addition to the numerous memorials and works of art created to remember the past, the most famous tomb is that of Simón Bolívar himself, the most renowned man in all of Gran Colombia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_popocatepetl_iztaccihuatl;§YPopocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl§!\n§YSmoking Mountain and White Woman§!\nThese two mountains overlooking the Mexico Valley are renowned for their roles in the legends of the brave hero Popocatépetl and the beautiful princess Iztaccíhuatl. Though the details vary widely according to local tradition, the common elements of love, death and grief are as old as storytelling itself. The mountains remain long after the lovers have gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_rock_city;§YRock City§!\nPerched atop Lookout Mountain, Rock City is a unique collection of cliffs, caves, gardens and rock formations. The underground waterfall Ruby Falls also lies inside of and underneath Lookout Mountain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_rushmore;§YMt. Rushmore§!\nThese enormous stone visages have watched over America since time immemorial, their unflinching gaze as steady as the land itself. Rushmore is a popular site of pilgrimage, serving as a source of pride for the glorious past and hope for the uncertain future. Whether they were men or gods, any American can draw inspiration from this monumental edifice.\n\nWashington! Jefferson! Roosevelt! Lincoln! America needs you now more than ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_salt_cathedral;§YCatedral de Sal de Zipaquirá§!\n§YSalt Cathedral of Zipaquirá§!\nThe Salt Cathedral of Zipaquirá is a remarkable holy site deep beneath the earth. Mining these rich halite deposits has created what may be the largest salt mine in the world, which has since also served as a glorious monument to piety. Many of the artifacts stored here date back hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, providing a unique window of insight to the lost past of Colombia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_stone_mountain;§YStone Mountain§!\nThis squat granite mountain looms over the farmlands near Atlanta. Besides the unusual geology, the mountain possesses an enormous carved relief of three figures on horseback. Whoever Jackson, Lee and Davis were, they must have been significant figures in Old America to be immortalized above their subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_tepuis;§YTepui§!\n§YHouse of the Gods§!\nA tepui is a mesa in southern Guyana and Venezuela. Over a hundred of these spectacular landforms loom over the savannahs and jungles of this region, appearing as islands floating over the surrounding landscape. The tepuis tend to be riddled with caves and sinkholes, source the occasional river and act as sanctuaries for unique flora and fauna. These unassailable heights are a ripe source of myth and legend, justifiably suspected of being home to gods, heroes and monsters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_tlaloc;§YTlalocatepetl§!\n§YMt. Tláloc§!\nThis holy mountain is said to be the home of the rain god Tlaloc, and has been for as long as any memory or record stretches. A modest temple in his service sits atop the peak, serving as a model in ritual and architecture for any pious supplicants who seek to bring forth the good rains!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_tortuga;§YTortuga§!\nThough a largely unremarkable and not particularly attractive piece of land, this rocky island has changed hands numerous times in recent and distant history. Successive powers have captured, fortified and lost it, leaving behind fortresses, watchtowers and settlements that still stand today. Perhaps more exciting are the endless rumors and tall tales of long-forgotten caves and mines containing pirate treasures, lost stockpiles of ancient weapons, and mythical sea charts that can guide the adventurous captain to exotic and profitable shores.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_tsoodzil;§YTsoodzil§!\n§YMt. Taylor§!\nTsoodzil marks the ancient southern bounds of Dinetah, land of the Navajo. The striking blue colour and prominent silhouette has ensured it remains in the minds of successive generations, and is said to be the home of numerous mythical figures who watch over the lands and people below.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_washington_monument;§YWashington Monument§!\nThis immense stone obelisk rises above the swamps of Washington, a true symbol of American ingenuity. Though time wears away at all things, rememberers of Old America lovingly maintain it to the best of their ability, hoping that one day the rest of the nation will return to similar glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_yellowstone;§YYellowstone§!\nThe incredible geological formations of Yellowstone are as beautiful as they are deadly. Thousands of geysers and hotsprings are scattered across this strange land, the water ranging from pleasantly warm and suitable for healthful bathing, to causing instantaneous death. Persistent rumors of the whole region potentially exploding in a cataclysmic upheaval have proven unfounded, at least since the last apocalypse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_yosemite_valley;§YYosemite Valley§!\nThis thickly forested valley is bounded by sheer granite mountains, many of which drop waterfalls hundreds of feet to the flat valley floor. Each of the mountains have unique silhouettes and have accrued names and folklore, such as Half Dome and the Three Brothers. The landscape is a true monument to the grandeur of nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_che_mausoleum;§YMausoleo del Che Guevara§!\n§YChe Guevara Mausoleum§!\nA towering bronze statue memorialises Che and a number of his fallen brothers in arms. Che, the mythical hero of Cuba is attributed with numerous legendary feats such as travelling all the Americas on horseback, defeating armies despite overwhelming odds, founding Cuba itself, and producing seminal works of literature that have influenced warfare and philosophy in the Caribbean. While such tales may be apocryphal, it is generally agreed that he was a prominent figure at the time and had a profound effect on Cuba's misty past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_guiana_space_centre;§YCentre Spatial Guyanais§!\n§YGuiana Space Centre§!\nMuch like the site at Cape Canaveral, Guyana has its own mysterious area of past scientific and industrial wonder. Scholars sometimes brave the journey overseas to  directly compare the two 'Space Centers' and divine some meaning from the remaining structures and local lore, but it seems unlikely that the secrets of 'Space Flight' will ever be rediscovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_cape_canaveral;§YCape Canaveral§!\nThis vast and ancient temple to the forgotten arts once allowed mortal men to touch the sky itself. The legends and mythology surrounding this place continues to attract pilgrims and visionaries from across America, each hoping to receive divine revelation or temporal power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_disney_world;§YDisney World§!\nRenovated and maintained by successive rulers, Disney World could be considered the standard by which all other noble estates are measured. The extensive gardens and parks are the envy of many, and the ornate stone fortifications are unmatched in style, if not effectiveness. It is traditional for the liege of the lands to invite esteemed guests inside to witness the splendor of his domain, partake in cool drinks and enjoy outdoor performances by actors dressed as mythological beasts and historical figures. This had led to Disney World becoming known as one of the most cultured and noble places in America.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_zocalo;§YZócalo§!\nThe Zócalo is the grandest main square in all the world, the reputation so powerful that every other city seeks to have their own imitation. For as long as people have lived in Mexico, the Zócalo has been the eternal site of public celebrations, religious festivities, military assemblies and royal events. Surrounding the Zócalo are all the greatest palaces and temples, and in the markets and stalls can be found strange delicacies from distant and foreign lands. One can easily find their way to the Zócalo from anywhere in the city, though getting back may be more difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_stetson_tower;§YTower of the Hat§!\nLong before the Fall, those who lived in this land erected a tower in honor of a land far across the sea, and a mighty city which bore the same name as their settlement. For reasons now lost to time, they also placed a huge, wide-brimmed hat on the very top of this tower. It has stood tall through the centuries, requiring minimal maintenance, and the people here point to it as a proud symbol of humanity's indomitable nature. One day, it seems to say, we will rebuild.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_crimson_library;§YThe Crimson Library§!\nBoston was one of the major centers of learning for the Old World, and students from all over the planet sought to be educated here. Some of these institutions have survived, ghosts of what they once were, others have not - only the bravest dare go anywhere near those ruins. The greatest among them, although diminished from the heights of its glory, still stands in Cambridge, and the mysterious Crimson Library is found there. It is said any knowledge you seek can be found here, but search carefully. The ghosts of the Old World are strong here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_saratoga_battle_monument;§YSaratoga Springs Monument§!\nA golden statue of some nameless Hudsonian knight stands on the site of the Battle of Saratoga Springs, where Norton Rodham destroyed Zadok Mahonic's much larger army, and Zadok himself was slain by the knight Darius Tregart. Here the threat of reconquest by the Mahonics was stopped, perhaps forever. At the base of the statue, plaques bear a description of the battle and the names of prominent men who died that day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_saratoga_race_course;§YSaratoga Racing Grounds§!\nThe greatest horsemen of the Old World displayed their skills here, and historical research suggests this was one of the very first sporting grounds in Old America. The course has been restored and maintained, and the lords of Hudsonia now use it for the same purpose. Hudsonian knights and horsemen train here daily, it is a favorite tournament site for the nobility, and every summer races are held here for the enjoyment of all who can make the journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_city_of_rocks;§YCity of Rocks§!\nA collection of huge stones and boulders pointing skyward, the City of Rocks resembles nothing less than the ruins of a city built by long-vanished giants. Whether created by nature or artifice, it remains a sight worth seeing, or perhaps just an opportunity to rest in the shade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_bandera_ice_cave;§YBandera Ice Cave§!\nMore than just a dead volcano, this site is unique in that it is filled year-round with ice. Scholars, theologians and lords travel from across the land to marvel at this inexplicable and decidedly chilling wonder of the natural world, usually finding the time to conclude their tour with ice-cooled drinks and desserts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_sistema_cheve;§YSistema Chevé§!\n§YChevé Cave§!\nAn ancient and vast cave system, Chevé has been used by the local Cuicatecs for burials, sacrifices and other rituals for hundreds of years. It is rumored to be so deep as to reach Mictlan itself, possibly making it the point of emergence for modern humans since the last age of destruction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_pacaya;§YPacaya§!\nThis volcano has erupted continuously since time immemorial. It regularly sents great plumes of smoke into the air and tremors into the ground, and has never been placated for more than a few months at a time. On rarer occasions it launches fire and stones across the landscape, blankets fields and cities in deadening ash, or even sends forth invisible choking death for those unfortunate enough to be close by. Despite all this, the locals consider it a mark of pride that they continue to live under the gaze of an angry god.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_belize_reef;§YBelize Barrier Reef§!\nThis vast coral reef stretches over the horizon and under the waters. Though treacherous and deadly towards ships that sail heedlessly, the reef is the picture of natural beauty. Speckled with atolls and sand bars, the reef system is a popular hang-out and refuge for pirates and others in need of a quick haven near the coast of Belize and Honduras. One persistent rumor regards what could lie at the bottom of the Great Blue Hole, with theories ranging from an immense wrecked galleon filled with dubloons, to an equally immense and hungry kraken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_playa_ostional;§YPlaya Ostional§!\nA typically idyllic Costa Rican beach, Ostional also has the distinction of regularly being swarmed by sea turtles after a full moon. The turtles arrive in the tens of thousands, burying their eggs all across the shoreline before disappearing beneath the waves. As impressive as the sight of it is, the locals are particularly fond of harvesting the many, many eggs left behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_boiling_lake;§YLago Boiling§!\n§YBoiling Lake§!\nLocated in the Valley of Desolation, the lake is an eternally-bubbling pit of strangely-tinted water and steam. The landscape around it is dotted with geysers and vents which often spray scalding steam at visitors or choke them with poisonous airs. The locals tend to avoid it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_bioluminescent_bay;§YBahía Bioluminiscente§!\n§YBioluminescent Bay§!\nLocated on the island of Vieques, this bay has the unusual property of glowing blue at night. Attempts to harness this magical liquid remain fruitless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_phosphorescent_bay;§YBahía Fosforescente§!\n§YPhosphorescent Bay§!\nOff the south-west coast of Puerto Rico, the waters take on the most peculiar condition of shining blue at night. Whatever the cause, it persists regardless of all attempts to study or control it. The ocean keeps its secrets well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_orinoco_delta;§YDelta del Orinoco§!\n§YOrinoco Delta§!\nThe vast delta of the Río Orinoco spreads out without concern, forming a system of salt water channels and innumerable islands covered in swamps and mangroves. At high tide it seems as if the whole of the land is submerged by the onrushing ocean, carrying with it schools of easily caught fish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_guacharo_cave;§YCueva del Guácharo§!\n§YGuácharo Cave§!\nThis cave carries on seemingly without end, leading brave and foolish explorers further on underground until either their wills or bodies fail them. Aside from the depth, the cave is home to thousands upon thousands of oilbirds which shriek murderously at all times until they suddenly depart en-masse at dusk in search of food. For those few who can bear the sounds and smells, the cave is an excellent source of guano.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_ny_subway;§YNew York City Subway§!\nAn intricate network of flooded underground tunnels lies beneath the streets of New York City, accessible through conveniently-placed aboveground entrances. Many claim that these tunnels were once used to quickly transport residents of New York from place to place, although some question how the tunnels could have been kept permanently water-free. Nowadays, the only people who enter the dark tunnels of the Subway are treasure-hunters looking for pre-Event artifacts and thrill-seekers investigating the persistent rumors of monsters lurking in the Subway's depths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_la_citadelle;§YLa Citadelle§!\n§YCitadelle of Quebec§!\nUnlike most fortifications in the Americas, the walls and forts surrounding Old Quebec were first built long before the Event. The centerpiece of the city's fortifications, the star-shaped Citadelle, still serves the same purpose today as it did back then, housing the soldiers charged with the defense of "La Vieille Capitale". It also served as the residence of Queen Véronique during her reign as Queen of Quebec.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_liberty_bell;§YLiberty Bell§!\nThis cracked bell has a history as old as America itself - according to legend, it was cast over a millennium ago and was rung to celebrate America's declaration of independence. Contrary to popular belief, the bell acquired its distinctive crack long before the Event. The Liberty Bell has become a popular pilgrimage spot for Americanists visiting Philadelphia, and its sides have become worn-down and smooth after hundreds of years of being rubbed by both pilgrims and locals for good luck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_the_alamo;§YThe Alamo§!\nThis remarkably well-preserved chapel was once the site of a legendary battle between the empires of Mexico and the Lone Star. Although many of the details surrounding the battle itself have been lost to time, Texans everywhere still invoke its memory as a rallying cry in times of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_roswell;§YRoswell§!\nThe area around the town of Roswell in Nuevo México is famous throughout Old America, and is said by many to be the center of intense supernatural activity. Rumors abound of inexplicable moving lights in the sky and people suddenly disappearing without a trace, but skeptics insist that the area is little more than a common patch of desert.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_bay_of_fundy;§YBay of Fundy§!\nThe bay between Alba Nuadh and New Brunswick in the Maritimes is known for its incredibly high tides. Traditional folklore attributes this property to a giant whale splashing in the water, but no sightings of this whale have surfaced in the time since the Event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_mammoth_cave;§YMammoth Cave§!\nThis gigantic cave system deep in the heart of Kenessee is said to be the longest of its kind in the entire world. Locals maintain that not even the ancient Americans were able to fully map it. Since the Event, the site has become a holy place for local Revelationists, who frequently delve deep into the cave to practice their secret rituals away from prying eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_kensington_runestone;§YKensington Runestone§!\nAccording to tradition, a gigantic stone with ancient runes inscribed on it was left in Northland by the first Norsemen to sail across the Great Lakes. After the Event, this runestone became a focal point for local religious ceremonies. Norsemen across old America regularly cite the runestone's existence as proof that their faith has existed for longer than either Christianity or Americanism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_atlanta_speedway;§YAtlanta Motor Speedway§!\nLong before the Event, this track housed great races in unfathomable steel chariots. Although the former glory is lost, the tradition of racing is not. Teams of horse drawn chariots race here to the amusement of many a cheering fan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_craters_of_the_moon;§YCraters of the Moon§!\nThe landscape in this area is notable for having deep cracks in the earth, hot ground, and giant stone cones, among other things. Locals insist that this alien landscape was much smaller prior to the Event, when the ground suddenly erupted with flame and brimstone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_white_sands;§YWhite Sands§!\nThe famous white sands for which this area is named are both cool to the touch and utterly desolate. Locals insist that the sands have been like this since time immemorial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_esclavo_libertado;§YEsclavo Libertado§!\nThis statue miraculously survived the Event completely intact, which local Santería practitioners attribute to the intercession of the Orishas. The statue depicts a man with broken chains around his wrist, symbolizing freedom from tyranny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_cristobal_colon;§YCristóbal Colón§!\n§YChristopher Columbus§!\nThis bronze statue depicts a man standing proudly and pointing off to the distance, while another man climbs up the statue's base. The pointing figure is revered by most locals, who claim that he founded Santo Domingo and, by extension, all of Dominica. Some, however, claim that the pointing man is a fraud, and that the climbing figure represents the true founders of Dominica.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_grand_teton;§YGrand Teton§!\nThis mountain is famous for its size and grandeur. Hundreds attempt to climb it every year, and those who ascend it successfully will discover a mysterious palisade of rocks on the summit, which the Sioux people claim was built by their ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_jose_maria_morelos;§YJosé María Morelos§!\nThis statue depicts a famous hero who helped win Mexico's freedom.
