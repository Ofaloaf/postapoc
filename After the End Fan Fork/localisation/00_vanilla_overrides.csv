DYN1_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Yudkow, Emperors of California. After the Event, California, the greatest and most populous of the former American states, fell into a period of constant war. Kings and warlords shed rivers of blood to impose their will upon the land, and great houses rose and fell with the tide. Elton the Lawgiver was once a philosopher in the service of one of these great houses, and when his lord was betrayed and murdered by his own retainers, Elton took it upon himself to fulfill the dream of a united California. His diplomacy and teachings on the Cetic philosophy swayed kings and armies to his cause, and those he could not persuade he defeated in battle. Loved by commoners and respected by nobility, Elton was not the first to claim the lands of California, but he and his house were the ones to make it stick, finally ending the centuries-long era of warring states and making California a beacon of peace, prosperity and rebuilding in the post-Event world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN2_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Iturbide, Kings of Mexico. The Iturbides accomplished something few ever have, restoring a pre-Event nation and having their empire universally recognized as a continuation of that ancient land. The Iturbides themselves even claim descent from an ancient pre-Event imperial dynasty, although this claim is impossible to prove. For a time, House Iturbide ruled over the vast majority of Old Mexico, and their empire was by far the greatest force between the Rio Grande and Rio Amazonas. However, the Iturbides' empire was lost due to a series of catastrophic events - the secession of the Yucatan, the Tripartite Revolt in Mesoamerica, and the incursions of the Atom. Nevertheless, the Iturbides maintain control of the ancient capital and stubbornly keep the memory of Mexico alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN3_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Royall, Emperors of the Holy Columbian Confederacy. In the 24th century, what used to be known as the American Deep South was in chaos. Backwoods tribes and scattered kingdoms warred endlessly with each other, and the Evangelical Church found itself under siege from a powerful heresy known as Postadventism. A vicious war between Postadventist and Evangelical kingdoms lasted for decades until Leonidas Royall led the Evangelicals to victory. Claiming inspiration from his studies of Old America, Leonidas consolidated these conquests under his rule, and then united all the southern realms under his banner one by one, be it by diplomacy or war. This was the start of the Holy Columbian Confederacy, an empire Leonidas claimed was the true successor to Old America. After a Confederate campaign to take Washington DC was stopped by a rare alliance of Americanists, Anabaptists, and Occultists, Leonidas stopped expanding the empire, but under his dynasty, it would become one of the most powerful and stable realms of the post-Event world, politically and culturally a hegemon of the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN4_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Rodham, Kings of Hudsonia. Claiming direct descent from one of New York State's pre-Event ruling families, the Rodhams marched north from Manhattan in the late 24th century to reclaim their birthright from the Occultist kingdom of New England. Taking advantage of local revolts against the Mahonic kings, financial support from House Wayne, and his own political savvy, the ambitious Ellis I Rodham formed a mighty army, which took the Hudson Valley and Albany itself within the first two months of his campaign. By 2381, he had united all the states under his banner save the Republic of New York, whose independence he respected out of gratitude for the Waynes' help years before. Under his family's rule, Hudsonia's fortunes would wax and wane over the centuries, facing periods of prosperity alongside the challenges of war, rebellion, internal religious strife, disease, and loss of territory to Anabaptists and Rust Cultists. In the end, the Rodhams' mainline faded from power, not through violence, but love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN5_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Sulley, Kings of Moskitia. House Sulley has ruled the Kingdom of Moskitia for over 300 years. Their founder, King Newman, is reputed to have himself lived for over 300 years, an unparalleled feat in the post-Event world. Under the guidance of House Sulley, the Kingdom of Moskitia became one of the oldest and most stable kingdoms in all of Central America even as the lands around them collapse into strife, serving as the core of both the Miskito people and the faith of the Falling Star.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN6_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Abbas, the clenched fist of the Imamite faithful. Their founder, Zakariyya I, is noted for supposedly establishing Socal, consolidating the Imamite doctrine from pre-Event understandings of Islam, and for living 100 years. They ruled valiantly through the Warlord Era of California, and submitted peacefully to Elton, being capable administrators in peace and iron hammers in war. During the upheaval of the Green Sash Rebellion and the subsequent collapse of Imperial Authority, House Abbas was overthrown by their once-vassals House Carmine, but legends and stories speak to the loyalists, faithful and disbeliever alike, who pine to see them restored to their seat in Balboa...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN7_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Tlgunghung, Kings of the Haida Tlagaang and harbingers of the Raven Deluge. Descending from the nigh-mythic King Yahguaas, the favoured kin of Raven, House Tlgunghung were the first to unite the strong but fractious Haida people after the event. Wielding faith and force in equal measure, they meted ruin upon the decadent Gaian realms of the Northwest, seizing their rich lands for themselves and reviving the ancient creed of Raven. Even after fracturing amidst disputed succession, House Tlgunghung continued to reign and reave across the Pacific Northwest, spreading the tales of Raven across the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN8_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Nokona, Kings of Comancheria. After the cataclysm, the Comanche, led by House Nokona, broke free from the reservation system and reconquered their ancestral homeland in northwestern Texas, forming the Kingdom of Comancheria. Although the founder of House Nokona, Pahayoko I, followed the traditional faith of his ancestors, his son Moseh converted to the Christian faith of his Texan subjects. This decision proved to be a wise one, as it reduced tensions between the Texan majority and the native ruling class while also protecting Comancheria from the threat of external conquest. Moseh and his descendants were thus able to consolidate their earlier conquests and make Comancheria into a stable feudal kingdom. In 2666, Comancheria has reclaimed almost all of the ancestral Comanche homeland and is by far the most powerful realm in all of Texas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN9_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Mahonic, Kings of New England. Vincent Mahonic was a mighty warrior who united the Occultist tribes of New England into one kingdom, then forged a realm that stretched from Buffalo to New Brunswick, earning a reputation even in old age as one of the most feared men in the Northeast. Vincent's kingdom would last nearly 200 years, but it was never the same after his assassination - his son Keziah lost all of New York to the Rodhams by 2381, and in 2459, New Brunswick and Miramichi broke away. Enraged, Zadok Mahonic called together one of the largest Occultist hordes ever seen and vowed to restore Vincent's empire, starting with Hudsonia. Instead, his army was smashed at the Battle of Saratoga Springs, where Zadok was slain in a mad charge against Norton Rodham. Zadok's death sparked a massive power struggle among the Occultists, who had lost faith in House Mahonic, and by 2500, New England had collapsed back into warring tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN10_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Castel of Quebec. Queen Véronique united Quebec in the mid-2500s, finally achieving the dream of a united and independent Quebec. Although her kingdom would not survive her death, Véronique's descendants held and continue to hold various petty titles in the Northeast. Two of her daughters married into Houses Groot and Lengacher, and her son Jacques was the Duke of Detroit prior to his murder at the hands of Overseer Coleman the Liberator.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN11_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Pitchstone, the Americanist kings of Dakota. Ned Pitchstone is widely regarded as one of the greatest post-Event Presidents, taking over after President Bannister Smithson was slain by the Deitsch, avenging him, and consolidating Americanist rule in the Midwest. His daughter Margaret was the first woman elected to the Presidency, but she faced a Sioux resurgence and Catholic holy wars, and after her death the kingdom was reconquered by the Sioux and House Pitchstone faded into obscurity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN12_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Yoder, who united much of Pennsylvania under the rule of the Deitsch. Though Deitscherei would continue under other dynasties for several centuries, House Yoder was wiped out when the childless Kaynich Abram II was murdered by Americanists. His successor, Samuel Stolzfus, avenged him by invading Washington and killing President Smithson, setting off a cycle of violence and retribution between Americanists and Anabaptists that ended with a brutal sack of Washington, D.C. Since then, the traditional Anabaptist doctrines of pacifism and religious freedom have largely been set aside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN13_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Tagötöka, High Chieftains of Northern Basin. Tavibo, known to his adherents as "The Holy" and to nearly everyone else as "The Mad", was a mystic who attempted to recreate the deeds of Emperor Elton I of California by preaching his own new philosophy drawing on Cetic, Gaian, and Mormon teachings and conquering a significant part of eastern Oregon. However, his empire never stabilized and, after his death, was divided amongst his children, who each took something different from his teachings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN14_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Soady. One of the greatest Viking raiders of America, Albert Soady embarked from Marquette with hundreds of longships for a great circular voyage down the Mississippi and up the East Coast, exacting tribute from or pillaging every city along the way and sacrificing hundreds, including President Anatol Avondale, to the Slain-God. He returned home with mountains of gold and united all the Jarls of Superior under his reign, but the kingdom did not last long after his death. His lands were divided between his children, and with none of them powerful enough to hold on to the crown, the Kingdom of Superior became a historical footnote.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN15_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Avondale, a wealthy and influential Americanist dynasty that produced three different Presidents over the course of 200 years. The dynasty was brought to a violent end by the Viking Albert Soady, who sacked Chicago and sacrificed President Anatol Avondale and his family to the Slain-God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Frankreich und das Heilige Römische Reich teilten sich die Herrschaft über den Westen und die Mitte des europäischen Festlandes, während christliche Könige gegen ein ungeeintes und geschwächtes muslimisches Spanien vorrückten. In Skandinavien breitete sich das Christentum schnell aus und die Wikinger, die sich in Russland und auf der Britischen Insel niedergelassen hatten, wurden von der dortigen Bevölkerung assimiliert.

EVTDESC_SoA_5346;My Lord, we have received an invitation to visit the holy Carolina monastery in Chapel Hill! The monks there are very protective of their domain, and it such an invitation is surely testament to your exalted status among men.\n\nIt is said that the Carolina monastery's status as a holy place began soon soon after the Deluge, after its grounds were left almost entirely untouched even as the rest of the town was in chaos. Its grounds were then consecrated and made into a great monastery. All women are forbidden to tread on its sacred ground. Monks, however, have been living here for hundreds of years, and more and more monasteries are constructed in the area of Chapel Hill as time goes by.;Mon seigneur, vous avez reçu une invitation pour visiter les monastères sacrés du mont Athos !

Et ce fut ainsi : la montagne et la péninsule furent consacrés comme Jardin de la Mère de Dieu.\nC'est pour cette raison qu'aucune autre femme n'a le droit de fouler cette terre sacrée.

Die Mönche tun sich schwer damit, eine Einladung auszusprechen. Dass Ihr nun eine erhalten habt, kann nur bedeuten, dass Ihr in hohem Ansehen bei ihnen steht.\n\nWie es heißt, wurde der Berg Athos zu einem gesegneten Ort, als die Jungfrau Maria dort wandelte. Sie mochte den Ort so sehr, dass sie ihren Sohn bat, diesen zu ihrem persönlichen Garten zu machen. So kam es, dass der Berg und die Halbinsel gesegnet und zum Garten der Mutter Gottes wurden. Allen Frauen ist das betreten der gesegneten Erde streng verboten. Die Mönche aber leben nun seit Jahrhunderten dort und im Laufe der Jahre mehrt sich die Anzahl der Klöster.;;¡Mi Señor, hemos recibido una invitación para visitar los monasterios sagrados del monte Athos! Los monjes son muy protectores con sus dominios y dicha invitación es sin duda testimonio de vuestra eminente posición entre los hombres.\n\nSe dice que el estado del monte Athos como lugar sagrado comenzó cuando fue visitado por primera vez por la Virgen María, a quien le gustó tanto que pidió a su Hijo que lo convirtiera en su jardín privado. Y así fue, la montaña y la península fueron consagrados como el Jardín de la Madre de Dios. Por este motivo, las mujeres tienen prohibido pisar en su suelo sagrado. Sin embargo, los monjes han vivido aquí desde hace cientos de años y cada vez se construyen más monasterios en la zona.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNM_9804;At long last, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has come home from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] quest to find a powerful artifact. Holding a golden sword, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] appears before you and, bowing, offers it to you. 'My [Root.GetLordLady], I have searched far and wide, and have found you the sword of the Archangel Michael himself!'\n\nOpening the box to sate your curiosity, you indeed find an ancient golden sword, glowing with an otherworldly energy. The sword does not seem to have rusted or tarnished at all, so it is likely that they will continue to survive for a long time to come. And so long as it does, it will surely improve the Christian world's disposition towards you.\n\nSeemingly expecting for you to speak, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] waits patiently before you.;[relic_hunter.Get_Le_Title][relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] est enfin rentré[relic_hunter.GetNoneE] de sa quête visant à trouver un puissant artefact. Tenant une petite boîte en métal, votre [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] se tient devant vous et, s'inclinant, vous la tend. « M[Root.GetOnA] [Root.GetLordLady], j'ai cherché au-delà des frontières et j'ai trouvé les os de saint Pierre ! »\n\nOuvrant la boîte pour assouvir votre curiosité, vous trouvez en effet les os vieillis et le crâne d'un homme. Bien protégés, il est probable qu'ils vont continuer à se conserver pendant une longue période. Et tant qu'ils le seront, ils amélioreront l'inclination du monde chrétien envers vous.\n\nAttendant apparemment que vous parliez, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] se tient toujours devant vous.;Endlich ist [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] von [relic_hunter.GetHerHis]er Mission, ein mächtiges Artefakt zu finden, zurückgekehrt. Mit einer Verbeugung präsentiert Euer [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] Euch ein kleines Metallkästchen. "M[Root.Geteineine] [Root.GetLordLady], ich habe überall gesucht, in Nah und Fern, und ich bringe Euch die Gebeine des hl. Petrus!"\n\nAls Ihr, um Eure Neugier zu stillen, das Kästchen öffnet, findet Ihr tatsächlich die alten Knochen und den Schädel eines Mannes, die man in dem kleinen Behältnis untergebracht hat. Solcherart vor Witterungseinflüssen geschützt scheint es wahrscheinlich, dass sie noch lange Zeit überdauern werden. Und solange dies der Fall ist, dürfte sich auch die Haltung der gesamten Christenheit Euch gegenüber verbessern.\n\nOffenbar in Erwartung Eurer nächsten Worte seht Ihr [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] geduldig vor Euch warten ...;;"[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] por fin regresa de su búsqueda de un artefacto poderoso. [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] se presenta ante ti con una cajita metálica y, con una reverencia, te la ofrece. "Mi [Root.GetLordLady], he buscado por todas partes, ¡y he encontrado los huesos del mismísimo san Pedro!".\n\nAl abrir la caja para saciar tu curiosidad, ves que, en efecto, contiene un antiguo esqueleto humano comprimido en el reducido espacio de la caja. Si se protégé correctamente de los elementos, es probable que perdure mucho tiempo. Mientras sea así, no cabe duda de que mejorará la actitud del mundo cristiano hacia ti.\n\n[relic_hunter.GetFirstName] espera pacientemente a que hables.";;;;;;;;;x

Il s'agit assurément de la couronne d'épines que Jésus portait sur la croix !;Bei [relic_hunter.GetHerHis]er Rückkehr hat [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] mir ein kleines, reich verziertes Kästchen mitgebracht. In seinem Inneren befindet sich eine alte, geflochtene Krone aus den Fasern einer besonderen Pflanze ... Sicherlich muss es sich dabei um die Dornenkrone handeln, die Jesus bei seiner Kreuzigung trug!;;De vuelta de su viaje, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] ha traído consigo una caja de metal pequeña y adornada. Dentro de ella se encuentra una vieja corona entrelazada con una planta particularmente espinosa. ¡Esta debe de ser la corona de espinas que el mismísimo Jesús llevó en la cruz!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNM_9810;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned, struggling to transport the largest menorah you have ever laid eyes on. Handling it delicately, and clearly treating the priceless object with devout respect, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] places it before you. 'I can scarcely believe it myself... this appears to be the holy menorah, taken from the Temple millenia ago.'\n\nIndeed, once you look more closely it is not hard to recognize it for the remarkable object that it is. Revealed by God Himself to Moses and unjustly taken from the Temple by the Romans, its presence is sure proof of God's favor!\n\nSmiling as [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] sees the realization of the menorah's ancient history creep onto your face, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] waits patiently for you to speak.;[relic_hunter.Get_Le_Title][relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] est de retour, apportant un bâton de berger apparemment ordinaire. En le tenant délicatement et en traitant clairement cet objet simple avec respect, votre [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] vous le remet. « Je vous ai trouvé le bâton détenu par Moïse, qui a divisé la mer Rouge et produit de l'eau à partir de rien d'autre que de la roche. »\n\nEn effet, une fois que vous le tenez, ce n'est pas difficile de reconnaître que c'est un objet remarquable. Créé par Dieu lui-même au sixième jour de la Création, celui qui le tient est sûr d'avoir les faveurs de Dieu !\n\nSouriant en voyant sur votre visage l'emprise du pouvoir potentiel accordé par le bâton, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] attend patiemment que vous parliez.;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] ist zurückgekehrt, zusammen mit einem augenscheinlich ganz gewöhnlichen Hirtenstab. Mit großer Vorsicht und offenbar auch mit frommer Scheu überreicht Euch Euer [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] den Stab. "Ich bringe Euch den Stab Mose, mit dem er das Rote Meer teilte und mit dem er Wasser aus dem Fels entspringen ließ."\n\nIn der Tat, sobald Ihr den Stab berührt, wird Euch klar, wie bemerkenswert dieser Gegenstand ist. Gott hat ihn am sechsten Tage der Schöpfung geschaffen! Wer diesen Stab hält, dem ist Gottes Gunst gewiss. \n\n[relic_hunter.GetFirstName] lächelt, als [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] erkennt, dass Ihr allmählich erfasst, welch enorme Macht dieser Stab potenziell haben könnte, und wartet geduldig darauf, dass Ihr sprecht.;;"[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] ha vuelto y ha traído consigo un cayado aparentemente normal. Sosteniéndolo con delicadeza, y tratando el objeto con respeto devoto, tu [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] te lo entrega. "Te he traído la vara de Moisés que dividió el mar Rojo y que hizo brotar agua de la roca".\n\nEn efecto, una vez se tiene entre las manos, no es difícil reconocerlo como el extraordinario objeto que es. Creado por Dios mismo en el sexto día de la creación, ¡el que lo posea tiene asegurado su favor!\n\nMientras en tu expresión se refleja tu comprensión por el poder de este objeto, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] sonríe y espera pacientemente a que hables.";;;;;;;;;x

With a broad smile, [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] gives a sign for the man to hand you the crown.\n\n'What you hold in your hands, my [Root.GetLordLady], is what I have determined to be the actual crown once worn by Solomon, himself.' Running your fingers over the engraved surface, you can see how great the craftsmanship truly is. To wear this crown would undoubtedly instill respect in even the most insolent of visitors.\n\nYou highly doubt it would work on [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] if you made [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] leave without a reward, though...;[relic_hunter.Get_Le_Title][relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] revient de ses longues recherches, suivi[relic_hunter.GetNoneE] par un de ses hommes qui porte soigneusement une belle harpe.

Mit einem breiten Grinsen gibt [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] das Signal, Euch die Harfe zu überreichen.\n\n"Was Ihr dort in den Händen haltet, [Root.GetLordLady], ist meiner Evaluierung zufolge tatsächlich die Harfe, die König David persönlich einst spielte." Als Ihr mit den Fingern über die Saiten streicht, ertönen Klänge, die beinahe göttlich sind! Wenn ein talentierter Musiker auf dieser Harfe spielen würde, würde zweifelsohne selbst der streitsüchtigste Besucher in eine gute Stimmung versetzt.\n\nOb es allerdings auch bei [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] wirken würde, falls Ihr [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] ohne Belohnung nach Hause schickt, das möchtet Ihr durchaus bezweifeln ...;;"Junto con uno de sus hombres, que lleva una hermosa arpa con gran diligencia, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] vuelve de su larga búsqueda. Con una amplia sonrisa, hace una señal al hombre para que te entregue el instrumento.\n\n"Lo que tienes en las manos, mi [Root.GetLordLady], es el arpa real que tocaba el mismo rey David". ¡Al pasar los dedos sobre las cuerdas, el sonido es casi divino!

Selon la légende, en son sein reposent les tablettes de pierre des Dix Commandements donnés par Yahvé à Moïse sur le mont Sinaï.\n\nAttendant apparemment que vous parliez, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] se tient toujours devant vous.;Endlich ist [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName], von [relic_hunter.GetHerHis]er Mission ein mächtiges Artefakt zu finden, heimgekehrt. [relic_hunter.GetEuerEure] [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] erscheint mit einer alten Holzkiste vor Euch und bietet sie Euch verbeugend an "M[Root.Geteineine] [Root.GetLordLady], ich habe weit und breit gesucht und habe schließlich die Bundeslade selbst gefunden!";;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] por fin regresa de su búsqueda de un artefacto poderoso. [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] se presenta ante ti con un antiguo arcón de madera y, con una reverencia, te la ofrece. "Mi [Root.GetLordLady], busqué por doquier ¡y he encontrado la mismísima Arca de la alianza!".\n\nEl arcón está adornado con una hueste de ángeles dorados y glifos antiguos.\n\nSegún la leyenda, en su interior se encuentran las antiguas tablas de piedra con los Diez mandamientos que Yahvé entregó a Moisés en el monte Sinaí.\n\n[relic_hunter.GetFirstName] espera pacientemente a que hables.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_MNM_9812;The Left Hand of the Lubavitcher Rebbe;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9812;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned, bearing a small iron box. Handling it delicately, and clearly treating the priceless object with devout respect, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] hands it to you. 'My liege, I present to you the left hand of the Lubavitcher Rebbe himself.'\n\nIndeed, once you look more closely it is clear that the box contains a human hand. The Rebbe's body was disturbed and thought lost, but apparently at least part of it has been left intact.\n\nSmiling as [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] sees the realization of the discovery creep onto your face, [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] waits patiently for you to speak.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9853;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned and brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a small box. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] claims that this box contains a fingerbone from the body of a famous rabbi.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNM_9855;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned and brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a set of small leather boxes. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] claims that these boxes are tefillin made before the Event.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_SoA_5050;Denver;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5050;You have finally arrived at Denver! It is situated on the South Platte River in Colorado, just east of the Rocky Mountains. The city itself and the nearby town of Aurora is full of pilgrims from all over the Midwest. You start to make your way down the road to Aurora, eager to see the famous horse statue outside the Día, or Day, Cathedral.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5050;The statue looks stranger than I thought it would...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_SoA_5051;Washington;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5051;You have finally arrived at Washington! Passing over the Potomac River, you enter through the city gate and are immediately overcome by a feeling of having made a truly epic journey. The city is filled with people of all creeds and colors, the air heavy with smells of strange spices and foreign plants. You make your way through the throng of people and animals, excited by the knowledge that you are now close to the White House and the other notable places. You of course plan visit the National Cathedral, one of the last truly interdenominational churches, but first of all you need to find someplace to stay. Apparently George Washington stayed in one of the inns around here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_SoA_5051;You have finally arrived at Washington! The city of Washington is highly important to the modern Catholic Church. In the time immediately after the Deluge, the Pope's appointed Legate to America witnessed a divine apparition while sheltering in the National Cathedral. It is said that he saw the city of Rome laid to waste before his eyes, and that the Virgin Mary then appeared before him. Mary told the Legate to make his way to Chicago, where "the remnant of the church" would gather, and to inform this remnant that Rome had been destroyed and that they alone had the right to elect a new Bishop of Rome. This vision is the basis for the current Church's legitimacy. As a result, the National Shrine has become a major Catholic pilgrimage site, where the faithful gather to show devotion to "Our Lady of Columbia".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5051;Glory, glory, Hallelujah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_5051;Truly, an amazing sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_SoA_5052;Chicago;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5052;You have finally arrived at Chicago! The mighty Holy Name Cathedral is famous across the Catholic world for being the place where the Council of Chicago was held. There, the surviving remnants of the Catholic Church in the New World gathered to decide how they should respond to the chaos wrought by the Deluge. However, the council was interrupted by the arrival of the Pope's Legate, who told the council of an apparition that gave the Council the power to elect a new Pope. A majority of the Council accepted it as true, but a small contingent of bishops insisted that the apparition was not credible. After nine days, the doubters left the Council in protest. The Council then elected a new Pope - the Legate himself. The city itself lies on the mighty Chicago River, and busy commerce mingles with the flow of pilgrims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5052;I will pray at the Holy Name Cathedral!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_SoA_5053;St. Louis;Nouvelle-Rome;Neu Rom;;Nova Roma;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5053;You have finally arrived at St. Louis! As you enter the Gateway City, you are struck by the many ancient buildings and monuments that you pass by. It is truly impressive, and you try to imagine how the College of Cardinals felt when they convened here to re-establish the Papacy's temporal authority at a time when the Church's influence was at its lowest. Though large areas seem to be depopulated, the city still boasts an impressive population concentrated around the mighty Mississippi river. The holy sites you want to visit are primarily the Basilica of Saint Louis and the Gateway Arch, as well as other antediluvian churches and places connected to the Papacy. You start making your way to the center of the city, hoping that you won't get lost in traffic as the crowds start to get more dense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5053;Truly, this is the Rome of the West!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_SoA_5054;New Orleans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5054;You have finally arrived at New Orleans, which contains one of the oldest major pilgrimage sites in America. The city is famed throughout Old America for its unique culture and great wealth thanks to its strategic location on the mouth of the Mississippi River. The famous Cathedral of St. Louis lies inside the "French Quarter", the very heart of the city.\n\nAccording to local legend, the current cathedral is the fourth to be built on this site. The first one was named for an ancient Saint who once ruled a great kingdom in the time before Old America's founding.\n\nYou make sure to take time to sample some local cuisine before making your way to the chapel itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5054;Truly, a unique city!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_SoA_5097;Atlanta;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5097;You have finally arrived at Atlanta! The city is enormous, dwarfing all other cities that you've seen this side of the Potomac. There is a bustle of people, commerce, sounds and smells that overpower your senses and leave you quite dizzy. As you make your way through the streets in order to find a place to stay, you are impressed by scale and number of the ancient churches and monuments that appear everywhere along your path.\n\nYou press on through the crowds, eager to finally look upon such fabled sites as the Church of King Martin Luther.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5097;Truly, this is a New South!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_SoA_5098;Pittsburgh;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5098;You have finally arrived at Pittsburgh! This was once the beating industrial heart of Pennsylvania, and it is here that a vast repository of antediluvian philosophy is kept, guarded by monks inside the Cathedral of Learning. Though no longer the great city it once was, Pittsburgh is still an important center of pilgrimage, and you can see many travelers in the streets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5098;Truly a city of champions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_SoA_5099;Philadelphia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5099;You have finally arrived at Philadelphia! This is the very birthplace of America, the first place where people actually began to consider themselves 'Americans'. The city was founded by William Penn, a devout Christian and one of the first people to urge for American unification. It was named for the virtue of brotherly love that is so important to Christendom, and it is from here that America began its divinely guided journey to greatness.\n\nAs your feet tread the ancient streets of Philadelphia, you can feel the history and tradition in the air around you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5099;Let brotherly love endure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5067;Washington, what a fascinating place! A holy place for many religions, the city and surrounding area are full of monuments giving tribute to both God and the Founders. Somehow when you look closer, they don't seem all that different. It really makes you think, doesn't it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_5067;Washington was a great leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMELoR.400;An Innocent Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.400;One day in the Imperial Palace, while surrounded by shouting advisors waving decrees and edicts that demand your signature, a small man approaches claiming to be a representative of Team Petty - the "Blues," one of the two major chariot teams racing in Atlanta. They no longer have the political influence they enjoyed in the days of Leonidas the Great, but they are still popular with the broad masses. You wave your advisors away and decide to hear him out.\n\nThe man introduces himself as Philander and explains that he has a proposal for you. If you race for the Blues in the grand chariot race next week, he and his associates will make certain you win. You both stand to gain from this, with the glorious [Root.GetTitle] winning as a champion of the great Blue team.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.400;An intriguing proposal... count me in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLoR.400;By cheating? No thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hippodrome_refuse;You refuse to take part in this scheme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.401;You practise chariot racing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMELoR.401;Practise Makes Perfect;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.401;You practise hard at chariot racing to better prepare for the upcoming event at the Atlanta Speedway. Despite managing well enough and only falling off the chariot a handful of times, you simply cannot see how you are supposed to beat the other professional racers. When you mention this to Philander, the little gnome of a man smiles and tells you not to worry. He assures you that the Greens, your main opponents, will not be a problem, and the other Blue racers have been instructed to let you win.\n\n"You had better be right about this," you tell Philander. "If I am made to look the fool, I swear I will not be the only one to suffer.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.401;Let us get this over with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hippodrome_tooltip;To the Atlanta Speedway!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMELoR.402;The Day of the Race;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.402;It is a fine day for racing and the Atlanta Speedway is packed with people wanting to see their [Root.GetTitle] conquer... or fail miserably in the attempt. Silvan, the star of the Greens, looks at you with scorn as your chariots line up. "I shall endeavour not to embarrass you too much, Your Imperial Majesty," he says through clenched teeth.\n\nThe trumpets blow, and the race begins! One by one, the Green chariots fall apart and topple over, giving you a clear path. Only Silvan's armored chariot remains of the Green team, but as your Blue allies move to block him, their chariots disintegrate as well. It seems both teams had the same idea. Still, you skillfully navigate through the wreckage and manage to hold off Silvan long enough to win the race!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.402;Victory, but not thanks to Philander!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMELoR.403;The Day of the Race;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Without their aid, Silvan steers his chariot past you and wins the race!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.403;Defeat! Philander will pay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMELoR.404;The Day of the Race;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTALoR.404;Back! Back, I say!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.405;The chariot race has concluded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMELoR.405;Another Proposal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.405;As you walk at a brisk pace through an empty corridor in the Imperial Palace, on your way to another tiring meeting with your advisors, you hear a faint whisper from one of the window curtains. After readying your dagger you pull the curtains aside to reveal Philander, the gnome-man who recruited you into chariot racing!\n\n"You! I should have you drawn and quartered," you hiss at the man. "The entire Blue team had their chariots fall out from under them!" Philander smiles at you, and speaks: "Calm yourself, Majesty. Your chariot held together, did it not? I have a new and cunning plan for the next race - one that cannot fail. Your epic victory will be celebrated for centuries to come.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.405;I may regret this, but I will join this scheme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLoR.405;Not interested. Guards, haul this wretched creature away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hippodrome_refuse_second;Philander is thrown into the dungeons and you put this vile scheme behind you for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.406;You resume your training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMELoR.406;Training Resumes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.406;You resume your chariot training and although you are an even better racer now, it still may not be enough to best the other competitors, many of whom have been driving chariots since early childhood. Philander approaches to tell you of his new scheme.\n\n"Behold, Majesty," he says, and produces a small bottle from within his cloak. "One drop of this concoction, which my associates and I only acquired at great cost I might add, is enough to send a man running for the latrines within minutes. Each member of the Green team will be offered some spiced wine by their quartermaster - a man in our employ - just before the race is about to begin. I think you can see where I am going with this, Your Grace...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.406;Good. This might actually work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMELoR.407;The Day of the Second Race;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.407;Once again you ride into the Atlanta Speedway in your chariot to the cheers of the people. It looks like nearly all of Atlanta has turned up for this momentous race. Silvan, your old nemesis, is instructing the rest of the Green team when their quartermaster offers them a sip of wine to fortify their resolve. All accept this offer, except Silvan. Instead, he loudly proclaims, he will offer his wine to the Blue team who need it more. Before you can object, the other Blue racers happily share the wine between them...\n\nThe trumpets blare and the race begins. Within seconds the first few racers leap off their chariots, sprinting for the latrines. Soon only you and Silvan remain. Fortune favours you, however, as Silvan collides with the last racer to abandon his chariot. This delays him enough to grant you victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.407;Victory, but no thanks to Philander!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMELoR.408;The Day of the Second Race;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He overtakes you in the final lap and rides his chariot to victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.408;Confound it all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMELoR.409;The Day of the Second Race;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.409;Once again you ride into the Atlanta Speedway in your chariot to the cheers of the people. It looks like nearly all of Atlanta has turned up for this momentous race.

It is obvious to all that foul play is involved. They jump into the arena!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.409;Back, knaves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMELoR.410;One Sunny Afternoon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.410;You enjoy a quiet moment away from your advisors under the shade of a tree in the palatial garden. A sound from above catches your attention, and as you look up you spot Philander, the chariot gnome, hiding on a branch. "Your Grace," he whispers with a smile. "Before I suffer your wrath, I ask that you hear me out."\n\nHe scurries down from the tree and gives you his new offer. "Fate may have conspired against us in the past, Majesty, but this time my plan is foolproof." He flashes a toothless grin, the closest he can manage to a winning smile. "Third time's the charm, eh, Your Majesty? What do you say?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.410;It had better be. I am in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLoR.410;You must be joking. Guards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMELoR.411;The Chariot;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.411;Philander brings you to a small workshop in one of the seedier districts of Atlanta. Here, he explains, they will weaponize your chariot. While you watch, the craftsmen install a pair of extendable metal blades into its chassis, intended to shred the wheels of any chariot adjacent to yours.\n\nYou train extensively with the new chariot until you have mastered its new weapons. As you are about to leave for the Atlanta Speedway on the eve of the race, Philander hands you a flanged mace. "For good measure," he explains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.411;Let us hope it does not come to that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMELoR.412;The Day of the Third Race;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.412;This is it, the final race of the season. The Atlanta Speedway is filled to capacity and a deafening roar greets you as you ride your chariot into the arena. You line up next to Silvan, your old foe from the Greens and the crowd's favorite. "Your Majesty," he says and spits on the ground.\n\nThe trumpets blow and the race begins, but it seems you weren't the only one to have brought arms. Everything turns into a huge melee as all the drivers hack and slash at each other using both handheld and chariot-mounted weaponry. Philander has played both sides against each other - there can be no other explanation. The situation escalates further when the agitated crowds enter the fray. You spot Philander climbing into Silvan's chariot, and the two of them escape the Atlanta Speedway through the unguarded exit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.412;Give chase!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLoR.412;Stay behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.413;You remain at the Atlanta Speedway to stifle this riot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMELoR.413;Aftermath;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.413;As Silvan and the traitor Philander depart the Atlanta Speedway leaving nothing but chaos in their wake, you rally the Knights of the Golden Circle to your side. Together with a squadron of Southern Knights from the nearby garrison you finally manage to bring order to the madness. The cost of life is great, especially amongst the audience, but it can't be helped.\n\nYour career as a chariot racer is over, but despite everything, you have emerged through all this as the strongwilled leader many feel the Confederacy needs. You wonder what possible motive compelled Philander to turn the Blue and Green factions against each other in open battle. For how long did he mastermind events with that purpose in mind? You will likely never know. He is now a wanted man throughout the Confederacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.413;Bloody gnome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.414;You pursue them outside the Atlanta Speedway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMELoR.414;The Chase Is On;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.414;You leave the madness of the Race Track behind and steer your chariot out into the streets of Atlanta, in hot pursuit of Silvan and the traitor Philander. With blades unfolded, your chariot smashes through market stalls and pottery in the narrow back alleys while a hissing Philander tries to give you a taste of the whip, without success.\n\nYou rush past the Stone Mountain and into the Antebellum Plantation as terrified deacons scramble to get out of the way. With a sharp turn you continue forward on highway 78, the main thoroughfare, and speed past oxcarts and the Forum of Atlanta before Silvan abruptly turns north, towards Johns Creek. He finally loses control of his chariot at a small market, and it crashes into some stacked crates. You step out of your chariot and draw your mace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.414;Give no quarter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBLoR.414;Show mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.416;You show mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMELoR.415;No Quarter Given;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCLoR.415;Silvan has been impaled on a nearby fence and his dead eyes glare at you accusingly. Philander, however, lies wheezing on the docks with a broken leg. He curses your name as you approach him with your mace. "Why do all this?" you ask him. "What could you possibly gain?"\n\nThe little man grins wryly at you. "Eons ago, there were four chariot racing teams: the Blues, the Greens, the Whites and the Reds. Then the two most powerful teams all but absorbed the two weakest. Who speaks of the Whites today? Or the Reds? Where is their glory? The domination of the Blues and Greens had to end, Majesty. At any cost. If my nephew Silvan and I could get them to wipe each other out..." You have heard enough. With a single blow, your mace forever silences Philander.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTALoR.415;One less headache for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPLoR.415;You show no mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHF23028;The more I read about ancient America, the more convinced I become that they did not worship [catholic.GetHighGodName], but the Founding Fathers. Their monuments and suriving literature provide seemingly-irrefutable evidence of this, despite what I have been taught.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF23029;In these past months I have immersed myself in the fragmented accounts of Washington's military exploits against the Redcoats.

EVTDESCHF23203;Jefferson is one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.

EVTOPTAHF23203;This shall be Jefferson's temple!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF23204;Lincoln is commonly accepted as the greatest Americanist deity outside of the Founding Fathers, thanks to his great his wisdom and humility.

The Crusade was officially canceled, as the Abbess held a large announcement denouncing the [From.Religion.GetName] Lords and Ladies for their ineptitude in the matters of Faith.

RIP.30300.d.shieldmaiden;Bards sing of a Shieldmaiden named Brunnhilde, or perhaps she is a Valkyrie walking the earth. Regardless, it is said she is another Immortal and that she thrives on battle. In the most popular ballad she teams up with an enchantress named Amora before being betrayed and trapped in a mystical prison. Her powers and mind are used for Amora's own ends, although eventually the true Valkyrie regains her strength and escapes. If these tales are true, she may well seek you out and challenge you to a duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEHF24200;The Blood of MacArthur;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24200;Legends about General MacArthur and his epic campaign across the Pacific are told throughout the known world. It is said that he was sent on his conquest by the great Roosevelt himself against the Empire of Nippon for their incursions on holy American soil. MacArthur took not only Nippon, but the whole of the East Indies as well.\nHowever, Roosevelt's successor was jealous of MacArthur's success and ordered him to return to America. Astonishingly. MacArthur agreed, which tragically doomed the Pacific to rule by Communism.\nRulers of creeds and nations across Old America claim to trace their ancestors to the fleeting line of MacArthur, yet none have been able to have such a prestigious claim be recognized by their peers and subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], I am closer than most contenders to the most likely locations, yet wasting time and resources in a quest that many have already failed to accomplish in the past might not be the wisest course of action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Yet wasting time and resources in a quest that many have already failed to accomplish in the past might not be the wisest course of action, especially given how far my expedition would have to travel to reach the most likely locations of the tomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TT_EVTOPTCHF24201;Abandon your quest to claim §YMacArthur's Bloodline§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24202;Ever since the Event, the legend of MacArthur has inspired many to claim that they had possession of his body. They knew that becoming the guardian of his remains would be acclaimed as his true successor.\nAnd in the same way, I am certain that by ensuring the recovery of MacArthur's body my claim to his ancestry will be stronger than any upstart [Root.Culture.GetName] ruler. Having already spent several weeks consulting the most learned scholars in the realm to gather more information regarding the tomb's possible locations, it is now time for me to invest in a proper expedition to uncover the ancient sepulcher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24203;Historians agree that MacArthur had a son who had already become a man before his father's return to America, yet the life of this child is shrouded by mystery. Rather than following in his father's footsteps and becoming a great general, his son disappears from the historical record shortly after his arrival home.\nHaving spent his entire boyhood on campaign, it is understandable that he would want to live peacefully from then on.\nIt is not so far-fetched to think that his descendants made their way to [Root.Capital.GetName] eventually, and split into the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName].\nMy scholars only need to find the right references in the ancient accounts of my dynasty to uncover this prestigious link.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24204;The valiant members of my expedition have finally returned to [Root.Capital.GetName].\nThey bring a marvelous gift with them: a mummified corpse, clothed in an austere uniform that they claim to belong to my distinguished ancestor.\nAfter a long consultation with my scholars, who carefully examine every detail of the body, I am certain that the expedition has been successful.\nAfter having been lost for so many centuries, the body of General MacArthur has finally been found, and I am the one responsible for its recovery. The only thing that remains for my claim to MacArthur's ancestry to become unobjectionable is to make this news known throughout the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24207;Despite all the sleepless nights, hundreds of researched scrolls and learned scholars, my efforts to find a link between my dynasty and MacArthur's unknown descendants has been fruitless.\nSurely, a man that has traveled so far and wide, that has achieved so much during his brief life and earned eternal glory would not allow his glorious line to die out.\nAnd a dynasty as powerful as mine, who has risen to hold the most esteemed throne of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] must surely trace its ancestry to the great conqueror himself.\nWhy is it then so hard for me to find the link between us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHF24207;Maybe I should focus my attention on MacArthur's tomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEHF24208;The Heir of MacArthur;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24208;After years of study, research and investment, I have finally achieved my goal and eternally bound my dynasty's name to one of the greatest conquerors of known history.\nLong after I am gone, people will look at my descendants in awe and tremble at the very thought of meeting them on the field of battle.\nWithin our veins flows the same strength that subjugated the East Indies, the same genius that cracked Nippon, the same ambition that led one man to bring down an entire empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAHF24209;Despite my best efforts, my peers have yet to recognize the legitimacy of my claim to MacArthur's ancestry.\nEven worse, my own subjects have reacted with apathy and skepticism to the news about my dynasty's prestigious founder. My councilors believe that the people are simply too ignorant to understand the importance of my discovery, while my peers are merely envious of its implications.\nFor one reason or the other, my quest is not over yet. My claim will have no value for as long as it is not universally recognized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAHF24210;There have been many rumors about [From.GetTitledFirstName] recently.\nUsing the help of charlatans, sorcerers and grave-robbers, the [From.GetTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has fabricated a ludicrous claim to General MacArthur's dynasty.
