#Events
EVTDESCIE1;I have just received an application to take the Imperial Exam from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. As the Evaluator of Merit for [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], it is my duty to either accept or deny each application.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE1;This application is fine enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE1;What even is this? [From.GetTitledFirstName] is totally unprepared!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE2;I have just finished reading your application to take the Imperial Exam, and I have found it to be up to my standards. Please come to the Examination Center within the next month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE2;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE3;I have just finished reading your application to take the Imperial Exam, and I regret to inform your that it is not up to the high standards of the Imperial Exam. You are welcome to write another application at any time, granted that you are prepared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE3;Disappointing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE4;Now that I am set to take the Imperial Exam, I need to get myself prepared through rigorous study. I can start by choosing which subject I am to focus on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE4;Math - numbers seem to elude me when I'm dealing with the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE4;Language Arts - I am unable to read a book without slipping off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCIE4;Science - I cannot grasp all the calculations and long-winded essays.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDIE4;History - Reading about the old and gone bores me so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE5;Now that I know what I am to focus on, I can now plan out how much time I will study.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE5;Reading a few passages before bed will do enough for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE5;I shall take to the book instead of to the hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
study_well_TT;Take your studies serious, though you may get strained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCIE5;Every free second I have must be used to put my nose in a book!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
study_hard_TT;Drown yourself in studies. A noble goal, however it might put unnecessary strain on your body and mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE6;I have finally finished my studies. Now I am ready to take the Exam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE6;...I hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEIE7;The Examination Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIE7;You arrive at the massive examination center, where [Root.Government.GetName] lords from all walks of life come to receive their certification. You enter, are greeted by the Evaluator of Merit, and are given a test packet and a place to sit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE7;Let me leave with the smile of a coyote, and not one of a lark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEIE8;Math Section;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIE8;You open to the first section and see the equations pile up as you start to flip ahead. The numbers jump out at you like a cougar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE8;Lets hope I remember the formula to this one...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ie_skills_TT;Your skills will determine how many points you receive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE8;I think I wrote some equations inside my hanfu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ie_caught_TT;getting caught cheating;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ie_suceed_TT;slipping past the eyes of the evaluators;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEIE9;Language Arts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIE9;You finally finish the Math portion, and get to Language Arts. Eyeing the syntax, grammar, and general style, it's obvious this was written by a Sacramentan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE9;Valleyan Grammars, don't fail me now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE9;I believe I still have some lose notes in my garments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEIE10;Science;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIE10;You get to the Science section of the Exam, and you skim over all the questions. Some of these terms you could have sworn to be names in a fantasy novel you read.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE10;I just need to get my head straight and see past the confusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE10;Do I still have that theorem sheet in my inside pocket?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEIE11;History;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIE11;That Science part is now behind you, and you get to the History portion of the Exam. Regnal numbers, proper names, and events meet your eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE11;Any proud Cetic knows the history of Cali...er...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE11;I think I have a summary of Californian history in my... ahem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEIE12;Bureaucracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIE12;Your days of recalling histories are over, at least for now. You have reached the final - and most difficult - section of the Imperial Exam, the Bureaucratic Treatise. You must now write an essay on the laws governing the realm. At least you get to choose the specific subject.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE12;I am the ruler of this realm, I should know this! Do I know this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE12;Maybe I can take some "inspiration" from a paper I read.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE13;One of the evaluators in the room glanced over to your table and caught you red-handed. They has asked you to leave the premises, and has failed you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE13;Very disappointing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE13;I am not one to take no for an answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
attempttobribe_TT;Attempt to bribe the test taker into passing you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE14;As I write the last few words in my treatise, anxiety washes over me. One of the evaluators takes my Exam and informs me that it will take a few days for them to get back to me with my score. I am almost unable to wait that long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE14;It will be finished in due time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE15;I have received the exam of [From.GetTitledFirstName], and now must go through and score it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE15;[From.GetSheHeCap] has passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE15;[From.GetSheHeCap] has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEIE16;Imperial Exam Rank;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIE16;I have just received a letter from [From.GetTitledFirstName], congratulating me for passing the Imperial Exam with a score of [Root.test_score.GetValue], and officially granting me a rank, according to my score.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE16;I am now officially certified to rule my lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE17;I have just received a letter from [From.GetTitledFirstName], informing me that I did not pass the Imperial Exam as a I received a score of [Root.test_score.GetValue]. [From.GetSheHe] went on to state that I may retake the Exam, though at a fee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE17;I knew I should have studied longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE17;Maybe some gold will sway [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE18;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent a letter, requesting that I pass his Exam paper, along with a considerable amount of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE18;The sound of the coins is too alluring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE18;I simply cannot sacrifice my integrity to make [From.GetHerHim] happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE19;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has accepted my bribe and passed my Exam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE19;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE20;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has refused to pass my Exam, though has decided to keep my "donation".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE20;Damn it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE21;As a [Root.Government.GetName] ruler, I must pass the Imperial Exam to have legitimacy among both vassals and peers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE21;Hopefully I can pass, and pass soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE22;[From.GetTitledFirstName] informs me that [From.GetSheHe] has abdicated his throne to [From.GetHerHis] heir, due to [From.GetHerHis] failure to pass the Imperial Exam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE22;Hopefully the next ruler can actually pass the exams.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE23;Now that I am no longer a bureaucrat, it makes little sense for me to be chained to the Imperial Exam system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE23;No loss to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLECETIC300;An Appointment by the Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCETIC300;[From.GetHerHisCap] Imperial Majesty's messanger has given me a letter informing my appointment as the Governatus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC300;I shall serve my emperor with pride!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC301;As the Governatus of California, the emperor tasks me with running some parts of the realm that [Root.GetSheHe] simply cannot attend to. Although a regent has been appointed by [Root.GetHerHisCap] Majesty, I must ensure that the realm is run by a trusted member of the court - me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC301;The emperor can trust me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
send_a_message_to_regent_TT;Send a message to the ex-regent of California, informing him of his reassignment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC302;Governatus [From.GetFullName] has informed me that I have been "reassigned", and now HE is the regent of California!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC302;That damn governatus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC304_WEAK;As my authority as emperor begins to wane, and the Governatus takes control of imperial duties, I have nothing left to do except shut myself in my estate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC304_WEAK;I hope I am better at painting than administrating...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCETIC304_NOTWEAK;With the Imperial Council ever so slightly now in your favor, you no longer are forced into confinement in the palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC304_NOTWEAK;At least some of my shackles are off...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCETIC304_FIGUREHEAD;As my authority as emperor begins to wane, and the Governatus takes control of imperial duties, my decrees and wishes have been taken to heart by nearly none of the Imperial Court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC304_FIGUREHEAD;I am beginning to feel trapped...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCETIC304;With a silver tongue and quick mind, I have taken back much of the control and influence Governatuss of the past have unduly stolen from emperors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC304;May this be a permanent change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCETIC304_B;As my reign goes on and my authority over my court begins to fade, I can sense myself becoming less influential among my vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC304_B;Soon I will regain influence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCETIC304_STRONG;Through bureaucratic skill, rigorous work, and a couple of... underhanded moves, I have full control of California!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC304_STRONG;May this be the case evermore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC306;After achieving victory over your opponents, your control over the Imperial Court has improved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
opta_excellent;Excellent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC307;As a skilled bureaucrat, your vassals are more inclined to follow your lead over the Governatus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC308;With a high Imperial Exam, your reign as emperor has been fully legitimized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLECETIC309;California Reunited!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCETIC309;The great bear has wrestled control of the empire from his devious vassals, and has reasserted [Root.GetHerHis] dominance over all of California! May my reign be bright, and may my heirs surpass me in its brilliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC310;After releasing my inspiring teachings, I have noticed that I have more sway over my court than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC311;After releasing my new teachings, I have noticed that I have more sway over my court than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC312;After suffering a defeat by your opponents, your control over the Imperial Court has weakened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
opta_disappointing;Disappointing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC313;As a poor bureaucrat, your vassals are less likely to follow your lead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC314;By failing the Imperial Exam, you have revealed yourself to be unfit for the tasks normally assigned to an emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC315;Without the support of the peasantry, the influence of your reign has weakened;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC316;As ruler unproven to the Imperial Court, the influence of the emperor has lessened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC318;As your regency drags on, your regent has been gaining more and more influence at the expense of yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC320;With your terrible treatise on Cetic theology being released upon the faithful to their horror, your influence among them as dipped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC321;The current Governatus of California has chosen me to the his heir to the governatus title!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC322;The governatus has informed you that he has chosen someone else to be his heir, and that he is formally rescinding his endorsement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hellbebahck;He'll be back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC324;My late [GetFromRelation] did not leave any will designating an heir to [From.GetHerHis] title of governatus. As a close relative of [From.GetBestName], I have a claim to governatus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC324;I shall do all that I can to carry out [From.GetHerHis] wishes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC325;My liege did not leave any will designating an heir to [From.GetHerHis] title of governatus. As the legal heir of [From.GetBestName], I have a claim to governatus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC327;Governatus [From.GetFullName] has just passed away, and in accordance to his will, I have inherited the position of governatus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hastalavista;Hasta la vista, friend...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC329;[From.GetBestName] has passed away, leaving me with no heir to my title of governatus...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC330;As my direct liege is now the Celestial Emperor, it is appropriate for me to take my place on the council in my role as governatus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC330;One must get behind someone before stabbing them in the back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC331;As the new Emperor of California, it makes little sense to be both governatus and emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC331;I reluctantly give up my post.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC332;The emperor has informed he has no use for my services, and that he is formally removing me from the position of governatus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
imterminated;I guess I'm terminated...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC332;I might as well mess the place up on the way out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
attack_emperor_TT;Pen a scathing review on the emperor addressed to the council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC333;[slanderee.GetRandomSlanderDescCetic] All that I can now do is pen a compelling narrative and hope the council is respondant to my message.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC333;I'll show the [slanderee.GetCeticTitle] who's boss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
furious_writing_TT;For the next few nights, you will furiously write down all that you have learned into what hopefully will be an eye-opening testimony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
do_poorly_TT;Your supposed masterpiece fails to sway the council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
do_well_TT;The council is taken in by your piece;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
do_excellent_TT;The council believes every single word you wrote;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC334;My letter to the council has gone poorly to say the least. I was barely able to finish it before they heckled me into silence. Sufficed to say, I did not sway them at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC334;Maybe it was a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
council_dislikes_you_TT;The Imperial Council's opinion of you has worsened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC335;According to a court ally, the Imperial Council took my warnings seriously, and their view of the [slanderee.GetCeticTitle] has soured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC335;I knew that my comment about [slanderee.GetHerHim] being [slanderee.GetInsultAdjective] got them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
council_dislikes_TT;The Imperial Council's opinion of [slanderee.GetCeticTitle] [slanderee.GetFullName] has worsened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC336;Extremely confident in the information I have, I went directly to the council to make my case. After somewhat nervously presenting the evidence that the [slanderee.GetCeticTitle] is [slanderee.GetInsultAdjective], the council looked aghast. It seems as if they have taken my concerns to heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC336;It's a relief to see I have influence over the Council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC337;As the Imperial Council began its meeting, a letter from [From.GetBestName] was brought before us. As it was read aloud, I could not believe what I was hearing. It seems as if [From.GetSheHe] is attempting to baselessly slander the [slanderee.GetCeticTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC337;The absolute nerve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
council_hates_gnator_TT;Opinion of [From.GetBestName] has soured among the council;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC338;During the opening of a new session of the Imperial Council, a messanger delivered a letter from [From.GetBestName]. During its reading, everyone in the room began to look more and more shocked. The letter contained allegations that the [slanderee.GetCeticTitle] is [slanderee.GetInsultAdjective] and unfit to rule, and it contains evidence to back its claim up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC338;I am in utter shock...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
council_dislikes_emp_TT;Opinion of [slanderee.GetBestName] has soured among the council;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC339;The meeting of the Imperial Council opened in a very unorthodox way with [From.GetBestName] reading a report detailing transgressions of the [slanderee.GetCeticTitle]. [From.GetSheHe] calls the [slanderee.GetCeticTitle] [slanderee.GetInsultAdjective], and that [slanderee.GetSheHe] is unfit for office. After [From.GetSheHe] finished, I looked around and saw that the other councilors had the same astonished face that I had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC339;The [slanderee.GetCeticTitle] is a scourge upon California!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
council_hates_emp_TT;The council's opinion of the [slanderee.GetCeticTitle] has taken a considerable dip...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC340;One of my councilors have informed me that [From.GetBestName] saw fit to slander me after I fired [From.GetHerHim], and sent a letter to my council implicating me in multiple uncivilized deeds. It seems as if the council did not believe him, as the letter ends with a declaration of support for me and against [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC340;Seems as if I got the last laugh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC341;As I entered the Imperial Court and saw my council, I could notice something was off. After receiving some piercing glares, one of my loyal retainers informed me that [From.GetCeticTitle] [From.GetBestName] has brought charges against my character, and the council believes it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC341;How could they accept such drivel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC342;As I walked into the court, my entire council storms me, asking me to answer for various charges against me, after recovering from the shock, I simply told them I had no idea what they were refering to, and moved along. It was only until later that I learned that this was orchestrated by [From.GetBestName], probably to get revenge for him being fired.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC342;I am not [slanderee.GetInsultAdjective]... am I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC344;The masses of California are easily swayed with bread and circuses, and the adoration of the populace is necessary for a [Root.GetCeticTitle] to wield power decisively. By delivering grain to the people of the Imperial Capital, I can gain more leverage over the Court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC344;Peasants can make do with what I can give.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
send_excess_crops_TT;Have your workers distribute excess crops to the people;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTBCETIC344;I will give all I can, within my budget.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
send_crops_TT;Have your workers distribute crops to the people;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTCCETIC344;I shall spare no expense for the people of California!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
send_many_crops_TT;Have your workers distribute an... expensive amount crops to the people;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 

EVTDESCCETIC345;My charitable donation of food to the people of the Imperial Capital has seemingly been in vain. According to my messangers, the food I have given to the peasantry was of a poor quality, and now [Root.CeticWheatponsibility];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC346;My donation of food to the populace of the Capital has been a great success! According to my messangers, the peasantry have been hailing my name, which tips the balance of power away from the [Root.GetCeticTitleOpp] towards myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC347;In order to gain leverage within the Imperial Court, I have decided to attempt to gain the support of [swayee.GetJobTitle] [swayee.GetFullName]. Hopefully, [swayee.GetSheHe] will understand my noble cause. Now, how shall I go about this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC347;My charisma should be enough;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCETIC347;Some gold shall sway [swayee.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCETIC347;I could use some... underhanded leverage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
not_swayed_TT;§Y[swayee.GetJobTitle] [swayee.GetFullName]§ not being swayed to your side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
swayed_TT;§Y[swayee.GetJobTitle] [swayee.GetFullName]§ not swayed to your side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC350;Dear [swayer.GetTitledFirstName],\n\n[swayer.CeticSway];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC351;Dear [swayer.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nYou have thoroughly convinced me to take your side against the tyranny of the [swayer.GetCeticTitleOpp]. You may consider me a close ally and friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC354;The Celestial Emperor has informed he that he has lost confidence in his current governatus, and that he is authorizing me to invade for the title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC355;I have won against the previous governatus! Now, to decide my future move...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC355;The emperor's word is law, I shall follow their word.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCETIC355;I have no need for that fool's word!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC356;The masses of California are easily swayed with bread and circuses, and the adoration of the populace is necessary for an emperor to wield power decisively. By delivering grain to the people of the Imperial Capital, I can give the emperor more leverage over the Court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC358;My donation of food to the populace of the Capital has been a great success! According to my messangers, the peasantry have been hailing the emperor's name, which tips the balance of power away from myself and towards him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC359;After penning an order giving certain powers back the emperor, it seems as if things have shifted, with the emperor's word having more sway over councilors than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC359;I hope His Celestial Majesty is pleased with my gesture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC360;[From.GetCeticTitle] [From.GetFullName] has ordered some of the authorities alloted to him be transfered to me instead, shifting the balance of power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC360;Seems as if [From.GetSheHe] is loyal after all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC361;I have received word that my chosen Governatus has just won his war against the pretender!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC362;I have received word that my chosen Governatus has just lost his war against the pretender;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC364;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] has requested that [From.GetSheHe] should be my heir as governatus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC364;I see no reason not to!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCETIC364;[From.GetFirstName] is just power hungry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC365;To my friend [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nSince I came to power, I have been waiting for a perfect heir, and one has just shown up! I know formally appoint you as the heir to the governatus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC366;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nAfter mulling over your request, I have come to the conclusion that you are not qualified to be a governatus once I pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC368;With the reconquest of a bureaucratic kingdom, my influence throughout court has risen greatly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC369;I have received a report that the [Root.GetCeticTitleOpp] has attempted to undermine me in my capacity as [Root.GetCeticTitle]! However, [From.GetSheHe] has failed in [From.GetHerHis] endeavor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC369;That snake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC370;I have received a report that the [Root.GetCeticTitleOpp] has successfully undermined me in my capacity as [Root.GetCeticTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC502;As a new Bureaucratic ruler, I am subject to the rules and traditions of Californian Bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC506;Through nothing but my bureaucratic skill, my peers have heralded me as an example to be followed, and many of my vassals have taken their word.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC507;Reports of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s bureaucratic skill has reached my palace. [From.GetSheHe] has been used as an example of a model bureaucrat, which has brought much positive attention to my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC509;By granting my council more power, the bureaucracy of my realm has become more efficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC510;As a skilled [Root.GetJobTitle], my abilities are utilized within [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. As a result, the bureaucracy of [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has become more efficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC511;[From.GetBestName]'s skills in [From.GetHerHis] capacity as [From.GetJobTitle] are unparalleled. Through [From.GetHerHis] diligent service, the realm's bureaucracy has become more efficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC512;Armed with an entourage of bureaucratic inspectors, I must now take the next week or so to inspect the entirety of [inspectee.GetBestName]'s realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC512;I must leave no stone unturned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC513;After performing a rigorous inspection, [inspectee.GetBestName]'s realm seems to be in line with bureaucratic standards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC513;Hopefully [inspectee.GetHerHis] vassals are the same...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC514;After performing a rigorous inspection, [inspectee.GetBestName]'s realm seems to have gone above and beyond bureaucratic norms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 

EVTDESCCETIC515;After performing a rigorous inspection, [inspectee.GetBestName]'s realm has failed to meet the bureaucratic expectations, and so I cannot pass [inspectee.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC516;Because of my... less than stellar bureaucratic skills, my peers claim that I am unfit to hold any title, and that I have harmed the bureaucracy of my realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC517;Reports of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s lack of qualifications have reached my palace. [From.GetSheHeCap] is used as an example of poor bureaucratic management, which is a blow to both of our realms...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC518;By having a weakened council, the bureaucracy of my realm has been lacking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  

EVTDESCCETIC520;[From.GetBestName]'s skills in [From.GetHerHis] capacity as [From.GetJobTitle] are lacking, to say the least. If [From.GetSheHe] is not bumbling through council meetings, then they are making the bureaucracy of my realm inefficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC522;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] will take steps towards having a more efficient realm bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC523;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] will not attempt to improve their realm bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC524;As the new ruler of this realm, some of the bureaucratic standards have slipped during the transition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC524;I hope I can reinstate those bureaucratic norms...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC525;After years of paying little attention to my realm's bureaucracy, it has come to my attention that many local bureaucrats have been taking advantage of my lax oversight, with embezzlement and lethargy being rampant among them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC525;Maybe I should look into fixing this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC526;After years of bureaucratic degradation, my previously highly functioning realm has slipped somewhat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC526;I must improve this situation immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC527;Through hard work both on the parts of my vassals and myself, my realm's administration has never been more streamlined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC528;After a series of administrative reforms, my realm's bureaucracy has become the envy of all others, with diplomats flocking to the capital to inquire about my techniques.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC528;It just takes harmony and rightful deeds!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 

EVTDESCCETIC529;After consulting with advisors about how to best improve my realm's bureaucracy, all I need to do is create a budget for this plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC529;The plan is great already, it doesn't need much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCCETIC529;I must give as much as possible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reform_alot_TT;Pump a lot of gold into reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC530;My reforms have not done well, to say the least. It seems as if nothing meaningful has changed, and all the money I poured into the project has disappeared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC531;After six months, my reforms have made a noticeable impact on my realm. Many of the corrupt bureaucrats have been reformed, and some of the administrative clutter has been lessened. There is still a lot of work to be done, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC531;This is a good first step.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC532;Due to my reforms, the realm's bureaucracy has changed greatly. The corruption, redundancies, and red tape have, for the most part, been cleared out, and as a result, many things run smoother. Although there is a lot of work to be done, this is a great first step.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACETIC532;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCETIC533;Although conquests have brought my realm countless treasures, the increased size has caused my bureaucrats many headaches. Messages cannot be sent to and from the capital as easily as before, causing a drop in administrative efficiency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
