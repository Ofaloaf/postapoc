The people of [FromFromFrom.GetName] will be less easily swayed by heretics in the coming years...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_eva.704;Like a shepherd, I have protected my flock.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_eva.705;Unconvinced by the Judge's words, you challenge their theological claims. A crowd of peasants gathers as you debate, but it is clear that they are unconvinced by your arguments. As their hostility becomes more and more apparent, you are forced to back down and allow the Judge to continue proselytizing. The people of [FromFromFrom.GetName] now follow the Americanist faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_eva.705;They are lost and confused, like sheep gone astray.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_eva.706;The Judge tells you of the Founding Fathers, of the Constitution, and of the principles of his faith. With each word you become more and more convinced and by the time they are finished, you thank them sincerely for showing you the light and grant them your blessing as [This.GetTitle] to continue their mission in [FromFromFrom.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_eva.706;I now walk in [This.Religion.GetRandomGodName]'s light.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_eva.706;From this day forth, I shall follow [This.Religion.GetRandomGodName] in my journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_eva.706;I am convinced, but the time is not right to embrace [This.Religion.GetRandomGodName] openly...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_eva.707;[Root.Holder.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from the Americanist mission in [FromFromFrom.GetName]. However, rather than quelling it, [From.GetSubjectPronoun] has converted to this heretical faith, and is now trying to convince you to join [From.GetHerHim] in worshiping [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_eva.707;[Root.Holder.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] is wise indeed. I shall convert to their newfound faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_eva.707;What madness is this? [This.Religion.GetRandomGodName] protect me, I shall not give up my faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_eva.708;News has reached your court from [FromFromFrom.GetName]. Your vassal [From.GetName], after trying to end an Americanist mission, has instead converted to the heretical faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_eva.708;Even the nobility has fallen into heresy now. [This.Religion.GetHighGodName] help us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_eva.709;[Root.Holder.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from the Americanist mission in [FromFromFrom.GetName]. [From.GetPossPronounCap] theological skill has allowed [From.GetHerHim] to rebuke the heretics, and the revival has ended. The people of [FromFromFrom.GetName] will be less likely to listen to heretics for some time now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_eva.709;Well done, my good and faithful servant.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_eva.710;[Root.Holder.job_spiritual.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from the Americanist mission in [FromFromFrom.GetName], having left unswayed by the heretical preacher. Unfortunately [From.GetSheHe] was unable to convince the local peasantry, and they now follow the Americanist faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_eva.710;May [This.Religion.GetRandomGodName] protect them in their ignorance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_eva.711;Your newfound faith has affected those around you. [From.GetTitledFirstName], your liege, has decided to abandon [From.GetPossPronoun] old faith and has converted to the Americanist faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_eva.711;Praise [This.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_eva.712;Your newfound faith has not been received well by your liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName]. Rather than seeing you as divinely inspired, [From.GetSheHe] considers you a misguided infidel.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_eva.712;Perhaps [This.Religion.GetRandomGodName] is not as powerful as I was told?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
