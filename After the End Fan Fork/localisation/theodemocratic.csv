mormon_government_desc;The theodemocratic form of government is very similar to the feudal system that is upheld across the post-Event world and the bureaucracy upheld by California. Emphasizing the importance of democratic value and how it is innately intertwined with the faith, [latter_day_saints.GetGroupName] rulers may hold temples as well as castles. Rulers may also freely revoke Judge titles and retract vassals, but otherwise must follow Feudal law. If you switch from a [latter_day_saints.GetGroupName] faith, your government type will switch to Feudal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TITLE_cetic_gaian;The Incorporation of the Gaian Faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_cetic_gaian;For hundreds of years, the Gaian and Cetic faiths have shared a close yet troubled relationship. While mostly mutually compatible, strife and struggle has remained, as imperial protectorates clashed with Cascadian swords. Long ago, attempts were made to bring these two faiths into harmony- but with the outbreak of the Green Sash Rebellion under Emperor Chad the Boneless, relations between the faith took a sharp turn for worse, and no attempts have been made since. However, in recent years, the Celestial Empire has come to rule over their northern neighbors once more, and in a reversal of prior policy, the court has issued an imperial decree ordering the reintegration of the old "Way of the Branch" in an attempt to bring Gaian rulers into the Cetic school of thought. Backed by the Emperor's power, this theological diplomacy is sure to bring many to recognize how their native Gaian faith can fit within the Cetic philosophy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
