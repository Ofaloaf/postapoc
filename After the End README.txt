AFTER THE END
A post-apocalyptic North America mod for Crusader Kings II
Version 0.9
Compatible with CK2 2.7.1 beta, and the Monks & Mystics DLC


	INSTALLATION
1. Delete any previous versions of this mod.
2. Download "After the End.zip".
3. Unzip everything to to My Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/mod (Windows) or Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/mod (Mac). If the "mod" folder does not exist, you should create it.
4. Open Crusader Kings II and check "After the End" in the "Mods" section of the launcher.
5. If you have Sunset Invasion, enable it and the "After the End - Sunset Invasion DLC" mod. This will not cause an Aztec invasion, but it will allow Native American faces to show properly.
6. Similarly, if you have African Portraits, enable it and the "After the End - African Faces DLC" mod.
7. The "After the End - Mongol Faces DLC" works on the same principle.
