#	home_court: all characters in the AI's home court, including prisoners, and characters currently away (wards, prisoners, etc)
#	vassals: direct vassal rulers of the AI's employer
#	sub_realm: all characters below the AI's employer
#	realm: all characters in the same top realm as the AI
#	dynasty: all members of the same dynasty (including the dead!)
#	rivals: your rivals plus any character you have an opinion modifier with 'crime = yes' set (the same set of characters the 'is_foe' trigger evaluates)
#	all: all living characters (Avoid if possible. VERY CPU-HEAVY!)
