neomayan - Neomayan

A mix of Mayan and other religions. Essentially a mutant form of the Mayan traditions caused by an influx of neopagans, hippies, alien watchers and others who flocked to the Mayan ruins (such as Chichen Itza) in the hopes of better understanding or surviving the apocalypse. No great secrets were revealed or spiritual shifts occurred, but their descendents lived on and absorbed the local faiths while sharing their own New Age guidebooks, crystals and broad knowledge of leylines and universal consciousness.

Chief god is Hunab Ku, a monotheistic deity invented by Spanish colonialists in the early conquest in order to weaken Mayan resistance, later taken up in popular culture. Other gods, demons, angels and systems feature.

Scattered around Yucatan.

A mix of Moravian and animism from the Mosquito Coast, counting as a Christian religion? Name/icon derived from the Moravian Star, and possibly from witnessing falling missiles/satellites.
