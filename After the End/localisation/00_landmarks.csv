landmark_angel_falls;§YSalto Ángel§!\n§YAngel Falls§!\nLocals claim with unusual certainty that this is the highest waterfall in the entire world. Originating from the heights of Auyán-Tepui, the stream dissolves into mist long before hitting the ground and forming a series of cataracts and smaller waterfalls. Any supporters of rival waterfalls would be forced to admit defeat upon witnessing it, as it is truly, undeniably, very tall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_arch_cabo_san_lucas;§YEl Arco de Cabo San Lucas§!\n§YArch of Cabo San Lucas§!\nAt Land's End, Baja California terminates in a cluster of rocky outcrops and islands. The natural stone arch resting at the water's edge is a popular site for pilgrims and vagabonds to visit, at least when the tide is out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_arch_st_louis;§YArch of St. Louis§!\nThis vast steel archway dominates the sky over St. Louis, leaping up to meet the sun in all its faded, rusty glory. Enthusiastic discussion of when it will finally collapse has not dissuaded a thriving marketplace from growing up under it and along the Mississippi riverfront.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_bermuda_triangle;§YBermuda Triangle§!\nAs with all traditions nautical, the Bermuda Triangle is as much superstition as practical knowledge. The waters between Bermuda, Puerto Rico and the Bahamas has the repution of being unusually hostile to sailors, swallowing whole everything from fishing boats to grand flotillas. Sailing the open ocean is not a particularly wise choice at the best of times, but the reputation of the Triangle is enough to ensure that all but the most foolish captains follow the coastline whenever possible, and keep the voyage between Bermuda and the mainland as straight and simple as possible, lest they become lost forever in the deep blue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_cactus_curtain;§YCactus Curtain§!\nDespite the name, cacti are not particularly common in this area. It is assumed to be a reference to the unusually old and robust fortifications ringing Guantanamo Bay, dating back to before the Fall. Cuban scholars continue to speculate on why Guantanamo Bay was so heavily contested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_cano_cristales;§YCaño Cristales§!\n§YCrystal Channel§!\nThis river possesses a truly unique appearance - the 'Liquid Rainbow' is variously red, yellow, green, blue, and black. Scholars and theologians continue to debate the significance of the river, but all can agree it is very pretty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_catatumbo_lightning;§YRelámpago del Catatumbo§!\n§YCatatumbo Lightning§!\nThe mouth of the Catatumbo River is the source of nearly nightly lightning storms, rightfully giving Zulia the reputation as a land of storms and fury. It is said that should the storms ever stop for good, it is a sign that the world is once again about to fall into chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_cave_swallows;§YSótano de las Golondrinas§!\n§YCave of Swallows§!\nIn the hills south of Ciudad Valles is this immense open pit, populated by all manner of colourful birds. At dawn they spiral up into the sky, and at sunset they circle the mouth before diving in. Oddly enough, there aren't any swallows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_cheyenne_mountain;§YCheyenne Mountain§!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_chicago_canal;§YChicago Canal§!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_chichen_itza;§YChichén Itzá§!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_cn_tower;§YCN Tower§!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_coffee_triangle;§YTriángulo del Café§!\n§YCoffee Triangle§!\nThe lands around Risaralda are famous for the production of high-quality coffee beans. The cool, wet valley climate provides the perfect growing conditions, and the local farmers use all their accumulated wisdom and skill to get the best possible yields. Truly Colombia is the land of coffee!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_columbia_icefield;§YColumbia Icefield§!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_copper_canyon;§YBarrancas del Cobre§!\n§YCopper Canyon§!\nThis family of six canyons cut through the Sierra Madre Occidental, eventually forming the Rio Fuerte and reaching the Pacific Ocean. The stark beauty of the landscape is without peer. Many towns have been built in precarious positions at the bottom and along the edge of the cliffs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_crazy_horse;§YCrazy Horse Memorial§!\nCarved into Thunderhead Mountain is the visage of the legendary Lakota leader and warrior Crazy Horse, who won such fame in combat that he is still reputed for his prowess. Such was the magnitude of his defeat of General Custer, it too was immortalised in the nearby lands so that no man may think himself above defeat.\n\n"My lands are where my dead lie buried.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_darien_gap;§YTapón del Darién§!\n§YDarién Gap§!\nThis region between Panamá and Chocó is unusual in its resistance to modern development. The swamps, forests and rivers seemingly unite to keep roads muddy, villages disconnected and trade at a crawl. While this isn't terribly concerning for the locals, administering this area is something of a nightmare for feudal overlords seeking to improve their domain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_dos_ojos;§YDos Ojos§!\n§YTwo Eyes§!\nThis immense underground cave system is marked by the two large cenotes resembling eyes. The true depths of these caves are unknown as they are flooded with seawater, but they are surely very deep indeed. Most popular guesses are that they lead to the underworld, vast treasures, or a sleeping monster that will one day awaken and destroy the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_erie_canal;§YErie Canal§!\nThis peculiar series of canals, locks and portages dates back to before the Fall. This waterway runs from near the base of Niagara Falls, across Hudsonia, through Oneida Lake, and finally meeting the Mohawk River. Though tedious and expensive to maintain, the advantage of a direct link between the Great Lakes and New York is enough to ensure it stays operational no matter the circumstances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

landmark_grand_canyon;§YGrand Canyon§!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_grand_mesa;§YGrand Mesa§!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

landmark_guadalajara;§YGuadalajara§!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_hollywood_hills;§YHollywood Hills§!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_hoover_dam;§YHoover Dam§!\nOn closer inspection this enormous waterfall is actually an artificial dam. What masters of creation were pre-Fall Americans, to leave such incredible works behind?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_lady_liberty;§YLady Liberty§!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_lake_guatavita;§YLaguna de Guatavita§!\n§YLake Guatavita§!\nLong possessed of spiritual significance to the Muisca and other inhabitants of Colombia, Lake Guatavita is persistently been rumoured to be the location of the legendary El Dorado. Whether man, temple or city, the lure of gold has drawn countless treasure-hunters to the lake. Diving, dredging and draining the lake have proven unsuccessful at discovering fabulous riches, but the occasional coin or trinket continues to surface and draw in a new wave of hopeful fortune seekers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

landmark_mississippi_river_delta;§YMississippi River Delta§!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

landmark_niagara_falls;§YNiagara Falls§!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_nicaragua_portage;§YNicaragua Portage§!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_panama_canal;§YPanama Canal§!\nThe monolithic remnats of these vast locks and canals have long puzzled and awed those who see them. It is undeniable that easy travel from one ocean to another would be a boon to trade, but how was it possibly constructed and operated? How large were the vessels that plied it? Whatever the historical truth, the present use is far more mundane. The remaining structure of the canal system has been worked into a series of castles and fortifications, with trade goods carried overland the 'old-fashioned way.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_pantheon_venezuela;§YPanteón Nacional de Venezuela§!\n§YNational Pantheon of Venezuela§!\nVenezuela has always venerated its heroes, and the Pantheon is nothing less than a monument to devotion of those who came before. These hallowed halls contain the mortal remains of countless fallen figures, many of them soldiers but also including writers, artists and doctors. In addition to the numerous memorials and works of art created to remember the past, the most famous tomb is that of Simón Bolívar himself, the most renowned man in all of Gran Colombia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_popocatepetl_iztaccihuatl;§YPopocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl§!\n§YSmoking Mountain and White Woman§!\nThese two mountains overlooking the Mexico Valley are renowned for their roles in the legends of the brave hero Popocatépetl and the beautiful princess Iztaccíhuatl. Though the details vary widely according to local tradition, the common elements of love, death and grief are as old as storytelling itself. The mountains remain long after the lovers have gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_rock_city;§YRock City§!\nPerched atop Lookout Mountain, Rock City is a unique collection of cliffs, caves, gardens and rock formations. The underground waterfall Ruby Falls also lies inside of and underneath Lookout Mountain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_rushmore;§YMt. Rushmore§!\nThese enormous stone visages have watched over America since time immemorial, their unflinching gaze as steady as the land itself. Rushmore is a popular site of pilgrimage, serving as a source of pride for the glorious past and hope for the uncertain future. Whether they were men or gods, any American can draw inspiration from this monumental edifice.\n\nWashington! Jefferson! Roosevelt! Lincoln! America needs you now more than ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_salt_cathedral;§YCatedral de Sal de Zipaquirá§!\n§YSalt Cathedral of Zipaquirá§!\nThe Salt Cathedral of Zipaquirá is a remarkable holy site deep beneath the earth. Mining these rich halite deposits has created what may be the largest salt mine in the world, which has since also served as a glorious monument to piety. Many of the artifacts stored here date back hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, providing a unique window of insight to the lost past of Colombia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_stone_mountain;§YStone Mountain§!\nThis squat granite mountain looms over the farmlands near Atlanta. Besides the unusual geology, the mountain possesses an enormous carved relief of three figures on horseback. Whoever Jackson, Lee and Davis were, they must have been significant figures in Old America.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_tepuis;§YTepui§!\n§YHouse of the Gods§!\nA tepui is a mesa in southern Guyana and Venezuela. Over a hundred of these spectacular landforms loom over the savannahs and jungles of this region, appearing as islands floating over the surrounding landscape. The tepuis tend to be riddled with caves and sinkholes, source the occasional river and act as sanctuaries for unique flora and fauna. These unassailable heights are a ripe source of myth and legend, justifiably suspected of being home to gods, heroes and monsters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_tlaloc;§YTlalocatepetl§!\n§YMt. Tláloc§!\nThis holy mountain is said to be the home of the rain god Tlaloc, and has been for as long as any memory or record stretches. A modest temple in his service sits atop the peak, serving as a model in ritual and architecture for any pious supplicants who seek to bring forth the good rains!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_tortuga;§YTortuga§!\nThough a largely unremarkable and not particularly attractive piece of land, this rocky island has changed hands numerous times in recent and distant history. Successive powers have captured, fortified and lost it, leaving behind fortresses, watchtowers and settlements that still stand today. Perhaps more exciting are the endless rumours and tall tales of long-forgotten caves and mines containing pirate treasures, lost stockpiles of ancient weapons, and mythical sea charts that can guide the adventurous captain to exotic and profitable shores.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_tsoodzil;§YTsoodzil§!\n§YMt. Taylor§!\nTsoodzil marks the ancient southern bounds of Dinetah, land of the Navajo. The striking blue colour and prominent silhouette has ensured it remains in the minds of successive generations, and is said to be the home of numerous mythical figures who watch over the lands and people below.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_washington_monument;§YWashington Monument§!\nThis immense stone obelisk rises above the swamps of Washington, a true symbol of American ingenuity. Though time wears away at all things, rememberers of Old America lovingly maintain it to the best of their ability, hoping that one day the rest of the nation will return to similar glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_yellowstone;§YYellowstone§!\nThe incredible geological formations of Yellowstone are as beautiful as they are deadly. Thousands of geysers and hotsprings are scattered across this strange land, the water ranging from pleasantly warm and suitable for healthful bathing, to causing instantaneous death. Persistant rumours of the whole region potentially exploding in a cataclysmic upheaval have proven unfounded, at least since the last apocalypse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_yosemite_valley;§YYosemite Valley§!\nThis thickly forested valley is bounded by sheer granite mountains, many of which drop waterfalls hundreds of feet to the flat valley floor. Each of the mountains have unique silhouettes and have accrued names and folklore, such as Half Dome and the Three Brothers. The landscape is a true monument to the grandeur of nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_old_havana;§YLa Habana Vieja§!\n§YOld Havana§!\nThe ancient city of Havana was founded in the distant past, presumably by the ancestors of modern Cubans. Built up by kings and burghers long forgotten, the old town has somehow managed to hang on through fire, earthquake, and war. Though the years have eroded much of the grandeur, the temples, fortifications and manors of antiquity still stand and lend much-needed stability to these trying times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_old_san_juan;§YViejo San Juan§!\n§YOld San Juan§!\nAntiquarians have declared that the foundations of San Juan were laid down more than a thousand years in the past, potentially making it the oldest city in the world. Old San Juan sit on an island on the bay, ringed by impressive fortifications built up over the ages by successive rulers who have favoured the island for it's prestige and defensibility. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_che_mausoleum;§YMausoleo del Che Guevara§!\n§YChe Guevara Mausoleum§!\nA towering bronze statue memorialises Che and a number of his fallen brothers in arms. Che, the mythical hero of Cuba is attributed with numerous legendary feats such as travelling all the Americas on horseback, defeating armies despite overwhelming odds, founding Cuba itself, and producing seminal works of literature that have influenced warfare and philosophy in the Caribbean. While such tales may be apocryphal, it is generally agreed that he was a prominent figure at the time and had a profound effect on Cuba's misty past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

landmark_stetson_tower;§YTower of the Hat§!\nLong before the Fall, those who lived in this land erected a tower in honor of a land far across the sea, and a mighty city which bore the same name as their settlement. For reasons now lost to time, they also placed a huge, wide-brimmed hat on the very top of this tower. It has stood tall through the centuries, requiring minimal maintenance, and the people here point to it as a proud symbol of humanity's indomitable nature. One day, it seems to say, we will rebuild.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
landmark_crimson_library;§YThe Crimson Library§!\nBoston was one of the major centers of learning for the Old World, and students from all over the planet sought to be educated here. Some of these institutions have survived, ghosts of what they once were, others have not - only the bravest dare go anywhere near those ruins. The greatest among them, although diminished from the heights of its glory, still stands in Cambridge, and the mysterious Crimson Library is found there. It is said any knowledge you seek can be found here, but search carefully. The ghosts of the Old World are strong here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
