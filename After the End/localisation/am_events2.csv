EVTDESC_salvage_peaceful;Mixed among the local residents in [From.GetName], you see the occasional soldier wearing the colors of [From.Holder.GetTitledFirstName]. Fortunately, the soldiers seem to be ensuring that order is maintained and the locals allow you to pass without conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_violence;Hostile Locals;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_violence;Your continued presence in [From.GetName] has drawn the ire of the local peasantry, and you are now confronted by a disorganized mob of angry villagers. They may not be well armed, and they're certainly not well trained...\n\n...but there are a lot of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_violence_flee;We should turn back.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_salvage_flee;Your Salvage Expedition is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_salvage_continue;Your Salvage Expedition continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_violence_fight;We can fight our way through!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_violence_fightwarband;They'll back down from a vulgar display of power!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_violence_bribe;Peasants like silver, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_drivenout;Driven from [From.From.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_drivenout;Hordes of angry local villagers have driven you from their lands, ending your Salvage Expedition. If it makes you feel better, tell yourself you left to avoid shedding THEIR blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_agent;Competing Salvager;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_agent;During your expedition to [From.GetName], you encounter an agent of an unknown lord who shares your faith. He appears to be scouting new salvage sites for his master, in direct competition with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_agent;May the best salvager win!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_agent_research;Direct him to a promising site nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_agent_intrigue;Make him disappear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_collapse;Collapse!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_collapse;You hoped the wooden reinforcement beams would be enough, but one of them slipped. The centuries have not been kind to the crumbling concrete and rusty iron, and the whole unstable mess is coming down around you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_collapse_flee;Run for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_collapse_brave;I won't let debris stand in my way!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_collapse_plan;I planned for this risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

preparing_expedition_desc;This character is preparing to go on a Salvage Expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_value;Salvage in [From.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_worthless;Your expedition has turned up very little valuable salvage. You have explored many ruined buildings, and everywhere you look you find the ruins picked clean.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_worthless;Disappointing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_worthless_compete;Someone has been here before me...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_worthless_research;There is another site nearby we could check.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_moderate;Your expedition has turned up a few items of useful salvage. In the ruined buildings and tunnels you have uncovered several artifacts of the Old World, though you have not yet found the kind of major prize you were hoping for.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_moderate;At least I found something.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_moderate_research;Hawk these trinkets, I know of another site.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe;Your men have discovered a large metal box beneath the ruins of a long-forgotten structure in [From.GetName]. The strongbox is corroded but still intact. Who knows what mysteries or treasures of the Old World are sealed within it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_safe;I'll know soon, crack it open!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_safe_patient;Have your tinker open it carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_item;Salvage;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_scraps;You have found scraps of Old World artifacts, but none of them are especially well preserved. There are objects that may have once been used for cooking or as craftsmen's tools, but it's hard to tell with the corrosion and decay of the centuries. They might be worth a few gold pieces to the right buyer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_coins;Your men have discovered a cache of corroded coins from the Old World. Their coins were inexplicably made out of base metals rather than gold or silver, dramatically reducing their value as working currency. Still, they might be worth a few gold pieces.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_glassware;You have discovered a long-hidden supply of Old World glassware. Unlike iron objects which have mostly been consumed by rust, many glass objects have survived. You need but wipe off the centuries and you'll have finely polished Old World artifacts that artisans today cannot replicate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_machinery;Amongst a wreck of disintegrated iron, you find a fabulously preserved piece of Old World machinery. Though stained with rust, the beautiful object itself does not seem to have rusted. It is about three feet across, irregularly shaped, with a half-dozen holes perfectly cut partway through it. It is constructed from a metal that is lighter than iron.\n\nThis will be a great addition to your great hall, or part of a shrine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_smash;Your men take to the box with hammers, and succeed in ripping the door off after a few hours. Whether it was the rough handling of the box, the ravages of time and moisture, or simple bad luck, you find nothing of value within.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_safe_jewellery;Treasures!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_jewellery;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a variety of Old World jewellery, glittering with gold, silver, and precious stones. The craftsmanship is finer and more intricate than what modern goldsmiths can produce.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_safe_ledger;Papers?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_ledger;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: several old folios bound with crumbling dark leather and stacks of identical green paper strips with the rune "20" in the corners. It's amazing how well the safe has preserved its contents, the seal must have been perfect. The folios are filled with line after line of numbers and symbols.\n\nYou would be rich, if paper currency were still in use.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_safe_ledger_amer;Ancient portraits of the Founders!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_safe_ledger_consumerist;Icons of the Almighty Dollar!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_safe_photos;Paintings?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_photos;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a collection of dozens of tiny paintings, discolored with age but extremely detailed. The paintings depict a family of people in the Old World. How these paintings were produced is a mystery to you, as the canvas is very thin and there are no visible brush strokes.\n\nThe cracked and crumbling condition of the paintings makes you think they are unlikely to last long after being removed from the sealed safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_musicbox;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a collection of small ornate boxes about the size of your palm. Each box contains a cylinder with patterns of tiny protrusions, adjacent to an array of metal tines of various lengths. You twist the small crank on the side of a box, it begins to plink out an Old World melody that probably hasn't been heard for centuries.\n\nThis will be a hit among my courtiers... a song for the ages!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_machinery;Machinery!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_electric;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a complicated piece of Old World technology, the purpose of which is a mystery to you. The artifact features several prominent finely blown glass bubbles, mechanical innards, and thin flexible metal strands that shed greenish-black powder when disturbed.\n\nYou are unable to get the artifact to do anything. There seems to be something missing that you don't understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_safe_firearm;Firepower!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_firearm;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a long metal tube with various bits of metal and brittle wood attached to it. You've heard stories that Old World knights used such devices to produce fire from nothing, but it's hard to believe you're seeing one for yourself. Though the safe has preserved it well, you will have to handle it gently and be unable to fix it if it breaks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_typewriter;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a well preserved piece of Old World technology with the word "Underwood" written on it in gleaming gold-leaf letters. Rows of thumbnail-sized metal disks are attached to the complicated mechanical innards of the machine, each labelled with a unique rune.\n\nAside from its beauty as a piece of recovered tech, this machine would probably be very useful if you could figure out how to use and maintain it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_calculator;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a well preserved piece of Old World technology with the word "Arithmometer" engraved in the metal in a flowing script. The machine is dominated by a heavy horizontal metal cylinder, with numerals visible through gaps in the metal shell and a hefty metal hand-crank on the side.\n\nAside from its beauty as a piece of tech art, this machine would probably be very useful if you could figure out how to use and maintain it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_watch;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a golden, palm-sized clamshell disk, attached to an intricate chain of gold. When you open the clamshell you see that one side is labelled with the numerals I through XII, and you realize that the artifact is an Old World timekeeping device.\n\nIt would be a stylish accessory for any lord, but it would be even more useful if you could understand its workings and restore its function.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_optics;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a segmented set of brass tubes with several curved internal mirrors and smoothly bulging disks of polished glass. The tools and knowledge to craft such a device have been lost, but you recognize it as an Old World version of today's spyglass.\n\nYou will be able to see things from a great distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_textbooks;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: several stacks of thick books. They have been sealed away from the ravages of the weather, but the centuries have still taken their toll on their brittle brown pages.\n\nWith luck, a scholar fluent in Old World languages will be able to extract useful information from the books before they crumble into dust.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_result;Salvage Expedition ends;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_result_poor;Not all Salvage Expeditions end in success. Sometimes the recovered artifacts are badly damaged, sometimes they are worthless, sometimes there isn't anything to salvage because the area has been picked clean, and sometimes dangerous circumstances interrupt the expedition.\n\nThis is one of those times.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_result_poor;Until next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_result_medium;You have returned from your Salvage Expedition with baubles and artifacts of the Old World. Although you did not find a tech prize truly worthy of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]'s favor, at least you didn't return empty handed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_result_medium_keep;I'll keep the salvage for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_result_medium_sell;Someone will buy these trinkets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_result_medium_donate;I will donate these artifacts to the techpriests for study.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_result_good;You have returned from your Salvage Expedition with an exciting tech prize, worthy of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]'s favor. Your court is buzzing with word of your success, and the techpriests are already coming to you with requests to examine your prize. It remains to be seen whether you can return the artifact to a functional state.\n\nThis will surely bring you fame, power, and understanding of the old world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_result_study;I must study and repair my prize.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_repair_prize;The Past Restored;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_firearm;After weeks of study, your armorers have finally restored your Old World firearm to working condition! Much of the wood body had to be replaced, but the metal parts were functional. The charges required to operate the weapon are in extremely short supply, as many of those found alongside the weapon were dangerously unstable and your armorers do not yet know how to construct additional charges.\n\nYou will be a fearsome and inspiring figure on the battlefield!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_study_firearm;This is my boomstick!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_calculator;After weeks of study, your tinkers have finally restored your numeric calculating machine to working condition! You are still learning how to operate it: you enter numerals by sliding the levers into the correct positions, then turn the heavy crank and the machine produces the result of addition in mere seconds.\n\nThis will make it much easier to keep track of the rents and taxes that are owed to you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_watch;After weeks of study, your tinkers have finally restored your gilded timekeeping device to working condition! Once the device is activated by inserting a key and twisting it, it begins to emit a soft ticking sound and the slender arms move smoothly across its face. You must handle the artifact carefully, because many of its small parts are irreplaceable.\n\nYou will be aided in any tasks that require precise measurement of time!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_typewriter;After weeks of study, your tinkers have finally restored your lettering machine to working condition! Their fingertips are black from handling powdered charcoal and other attempts at creating a useful ink. Study of the device has revealed much about the prowess of Old World smiths.\n\nYou are now able to issue decrees in the neat, authoritative letters of Underwood himself!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_optics;After weeks of study, your tinkers have finally restored your brass spyglass to working condition! Polishing with a soft cloth has brought the shine back to the metal, while the glass optics have retained their nearly perfect transparency. When you look through the eyepiece you are able to see things at a distance others could only dream about, even gazing at the Moon and stars as the people of the Old World must have.\n\nThe potential military advantages are enormous!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_textbooks;After weeks of study, your scholars have learned many things about your collection of pre-calamity books. Several of the books have fallen to pieces during transport or study, but those that survived are providing valuable insight into medicine, engineering, and other topics.\n\nMore study will reveal additional secrets of the old world!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_fail_prize;Unsolved Mysteries;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_fail;Despite weeks of effort you have failed to restore your salvaged prize to a useful state. Your assistants don't possess the knowledge or the tools to help you accomplish this task, and your efforts only seem to be causing additional damage. Major portions of the prize are damaged or missing, and there may be some mystical component required to make the device function that is not available to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_study_keep;I can still display it as art.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_study_sell;Someone will buy it from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_study_learn;The real prize is the knowledge I've gained.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TXT_bequeth_lost;The artifact is lost to the ages;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_firearm_battle;Take Aim!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_firearm_battle;An arrow glances off your armor as the battle is joined, the air fills with a flurry of battle cries, and you hear the ringing sound of steel on steel.\n\nYour foes surge towards you, but you raise your Old World firearm to single out a looming warrior leading the charge. You pull the trigger and the warrior is felled with a deafening blast of light and smoke, his armor useless.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_firearm_battle_fire;None dare to oppose the Firebringer!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_firearm_battle_thunder;Fools, I am the Thunderhand!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_firearm_battle_marksman;My marksmanship is perfect.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_firearm_battle_default;Run from me, cowards!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_typewriter_history;Storytelling;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_typewriter_history;Sometimes you feel the urge to use your Old World typewriter to write things beyond the normal decrees, proclamations, and correspondence. Perhaps history will remember you more favorably if your thoughts on the events of the day are recorded in your own neatly machine-lettered words.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_typewriter_history_record;My dynasty will be remembered.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_typewriter_history_poet;I'll tell a rousing story.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_typewriter_history_square;I will use it only for affairs of state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_calculator_taxes;Death and Taxes;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_calculator_taxes;It may be boring, but it is a crucial task for any [Root.GetTitle] to ensure that his expected tax revenue matches the rents paid by his vassals. Your Old World Arithmometer has made it much easier for you to do just that. You feel much more confident calculating the expected contents of your treasury, and can ensure that the numbers reported by your advisers are accurate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_calculator_taxes_shrewd;This enhances my reputation for shrewdness.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_calculator_taxes_machine;I'm more machine than man!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_calculator_taxes_default;Some of my vassals are short a few coins.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_watch_smooth;Precision in All Things;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_watch_smooth;Since you acquired your Old World pocket watch, you feel like things have been running like... well, clockwork. You are able to bring precision and confidence to any issue you face. While others struggle with primitive sundials, you keep your stylish ticking companion with you at all times.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_watch_smooth_style;Plus, it goes with everything!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_watch_smooth_carriage;I make the carriages run on time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_watch_smooth_default;Well, I am pretty great.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_telescope_stargaze;Watch the Skies;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_telescope_stargaze;Sometimes you take your Old World telescope to a high tower late at night, and gaze through it at the sky. Some might consider it frivolous, but you find it relaxing to see the Moon and wandering stars in a way few have since the calamity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_telescope_stargaze_astro;I'll study the wandering stars, also known as planets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_telescope_stargaze_military;My telescope should be reserved for scouting.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_telescope_stargaze_calm;It's very calming.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_textbooks_medical;Intense Study;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_textbooks_medical;You have been spending some time studying your collection of Old World books. You are not fully fluent in the language, but you have determined that one of the books is a manual of Old World treatments for human disease. Though some of the words are arcane and confusing, there are many useful anatomical diagrams and descriptions of healing techniques.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_textbooks_medical_wound;This will help me heal my wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_textbooks_medical_ill;This will help me cure my illness.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

His name is [From.GetTitledFirstName], and he claims to be a wandering merchant of the Consumerist faith. He trades in luxuries and specializes in acquiring rare and unique artifacts.\n\nAfter all, who doesn't need a bit more luxury in their life?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

They have anchored themselves a respectful distance from the docks, and the local authorities are requesting that you deal with the outsiders if and when they dispatch landing parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_arrive_audience;This could be important, I will grant them an audience.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_arrive_repel;Outsiders are trouble. Drive off their landing parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_overseas_audience;A Foreign Audience;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_overseas_audience;One of the foreigners steps forward and speaks in the archaic tongue of the Old World. Though his words are stilted and heavily accented, you can understand some of what he says and your court scholars are able to fill in the rest.\n\nThe spokesman explains that they are explorers and merchants, travelling far across the ocean to bring knowledge and wealth to their patron. Recent discoveries and court fashions have spurred a desire for certain goods that have been absent or scarce in their homeland for centuries. He claims you stand to be enriched as well by this lucrative trade. As you speak with him, the other foreigners occasionally converse quietly in a wholly unknown language.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_audience_allow;Give them access to our markets and harbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_audience_tax;They can trade, but they will pay extra tariffs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_overseas_seize;Foreign Plunder;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_overseas_seize;Your men board the foreign ships, putting their sailors to the sword as they scream for mercy in an incomprehensible tongue. The holds contain chests of silver, fine textiles, glassware, and other valuables.\n\nThe ships themselves are also valuable prizes, with numerous design improvements over the common galley. Your shipwrights will learn new shipbuilding techniques from studying them, while a trove of maps and navigational tools will be useful to your cartographers and sailors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_overseas_friendly;Another Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_overseas_friendly;The foreigners are pleased with your decision, and present you with gifts of silver, colored glass, and smoothly carved white stone.\n\nThe foreign spokesman makes another offer in the words of the distant past: several of his men will remain behind in your court, to study the language and culture of your realm and perhaps teach your scholars their own language. This will ease future communication difficulties and solidify a profitable long-term trading partnership.\n\nYou catch disapproving looks from a few of the more zealous members of your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_friendly_allow;We have much to learn from each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_overseas_carouse;The common folk in [Root.County.GetName] are in an uproar about a group of foreign merchants carousing and flouting the law. The local authorities have turned a blind eye to their crimes, which reportedly include assault and rape. If something is not done soon, the situation may escalate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_carouse_shutdown;Shut down the foreign merchants.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_carouse_localauth;Force the local lords to take responsibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_carouse_ignore;This doesn't seem like my problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_overseas_shipwreck;There are rumors of a foreign merchant shipwreck off the coast of [Root.County.GetName]. According to the tale, the wrecked ship is from a distant land far across the ocean.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_shipwreck_survivors;The survivors can join my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_shipwreck_ignore;Let them fend for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_shipwreck_salvage;No survivors means I keep the salvage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_overseas_newtrades;Foreign merchants have anchored their ships off the coast of [Root.County.GetName] and requested permission to begin trading though the local port. Given your dynasty's established partnership with other foreign merchants, they expect you will allow them to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_newtrades_rep;Yes, and they may send a representative to my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_newtrades_tariff;Yes, more trade means more tariffs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_newtrades_reject;No, we have enough outsiders already.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_overseas_tariffs;Silver and exotic foreign goods are filling the coffers of local merchants in [Root.County.GetName]. Your burghers are pleased with the expanded trade, not to mention the influx of tariffs into the royal treasury.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_tariffs;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_overseas_innovate;Your scholars report that [From.GetTitledFirstName], a [From.Culture.GetName] merchant residing at your court, has a number of interesting foreign ideas. They wish to spend time investigating and adapting [From.GetPossPronoun] ideas to benefit the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_innovate_econ;Focus on the productive ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_innovate_cult;Focus on the artistic ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_innovate_reject;[From.Culture.GetName] ideas have no place in my realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_overseas_insult;[From.GetTitledFirstName], a [From.Culture.GetName] scholar residing at your court, gravely insulted you in front of several other courtiers. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] is not yet fully comfortable with [Root.Culture.GetName] language or customs, so it may have been a simple cultural misunderstanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_insult_forgive;I'm sure it was just a mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_insult_punish;Mistake or not, [From.GetSubjectPronoun] be punished.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_overseas_convert;[From.GetTitledFirstName], a [From.Culture.GetName] scholar residing at your court, has been speaking convincingly about [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. If this continues, there is a risk of someone in your court taking [From.GetPossPronoun] words to heart and converting to the [From.Religion.GetName] faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_convert_lazy;[From.GetSubjectPronounCap] has a right to speak.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_overseas_ask;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is requesting approval to travel with the foreign merchants from across the ocean. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] will spend several years aboard their ships, returning home with the knowledge and wealth of distant exotic lands. No such journey is without its risks, but your [GetFromRelation] is willing to brave the dangers for the chance to let [From.GetPossPronoun] name ring out on the adventure of a lifetime!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_ask_deny;No, I have need of you in my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_overseas_ask_allow;Go with my blessing, and bring glory to your name.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_overseas_return;Your [GetFromRelation] returns;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_overseas_return_die;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has returned from [From.GetPossPronoun] overseas mercantile adventure. Or at least his remains have returned.\n\nThe ship that was supposed to be bearing your [GetFromRelation] is instead bearing [From.GetPossPronoun] bones. The merchants [From.GetSubjectPronoun] travelled with are apologetic as they solemnly return [From.GetPossPronoun] belongings.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_overseas_return_maim;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has returned from [From.GetPossPronoun] overseas mercantile adventure. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] is in poor condition, battered by a terrible journey.\n\nYou are unsure whether [From.GetSubjectPronoun] will live to tell you story. Pirates, disease, or powerful storms? What terrible events could have befallen [From.GetObjectPronoun]?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_overseas_return_scar;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has returned from [From.GetPossPronoun] overseas mercantile adventure. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] looks as though [From.GetSubjectPronoun] has seen a great deal of combat.\n\nWith a new scar across [From.GetPossPronoun] face and a battle-hardened demeanor, [From.GetFirstName] strikes a more imposing figure than the day [From.GetSubjectPronoun] left. From the respect [From.GetPossPronoun] shipmates show [From.GetObjectPronoun], you would wager [From.GetSubjectPronoun] fought skillfully alongside many of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_overseas_return_symp;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has returned from [From.GetPossPronoun] overseas mercantile adventure. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] appears healthy and and on good terms with [From.GetPossPronoun] shipmates.\n\n[From.GetFirstName] seems to show greater tolerance of foreign cultures and faiths. The church may frown upon fraternizing with infidels, but the chests of silver and luxury goods your [GetFromRelation] has returned with speak for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_overseas_return_pirate;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has returned from [From.GetPossPronoun] overseas mercantile adventure. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] has brought back numerous chests of goods, as well as a boorish attitude.\n\nWhile [From.GetFirstName] has brought back a great deal of wealth, you have a suspicion that it may be ill-gotten. Is it possible that your [GetFromRelation] spent the years resorting to piracy rather than honest trading?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_overseas_return_bastard;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has returned from [From.GetPossPronoun] overseas mercantile adventure. In addition to valuable luxury goods, [From.GetSubjectPronoun] has returned with a bastard child.\n\nFrom the look in your [GetFromRelation]'s eyes, there must be a sad story behind the birth of the infant. Perhaps one day [From.GetSubjectPronoun] will share it with you, but for now [From.GetSubjectPronoun] just seems glad to be home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_overseas_return_leader;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has returned from [From.GetPossPronoun] overseas mercantile adventure, which appears to have been a resounding success!\n\nFrom the deference shown to [From.GetObjectPronoun] by the crew, it appears your [GetFromRelation] holds an important leadership position among the merchants. Numerous chests heavy with gold, spices, silks, and other exotic luxuries are unloaded from the ships. All of this wealth is a testament to the shrewd negotiation and silver-tongued diplomacy of your [GetFromRelation], who has brought glory both to [From.GetObjectPronoun]self and to your dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_pirate_unrest;[From.County.GetName] is too far inland to be reached by the power of [From.Holder.Religion.GetRandomGodName].\n\nThe landlubbers of [From.County.GetName] don't care for the [From.Holder.Religion.GetName] faith, and those that do follow the faith are restless so far from the sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_snake_safe_testify;Testify about the miraculous.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_snake_bite;The serpent is unusually active, and snaps its venomous jaws a few times even before it is offered to you. By the time it arrives in your hands, it seems to have been riled up, and it attempts to bite you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_snake_bite_fight;Snake neck snap! Huttah!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_snake_bite_bit;Ouch!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_snake_convert_revel;The poison courses through your veins, and you collapse in pain. In your delirium, you have a series of potent visions. In the most powerful vision, you realize that [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] and Jesus are one and the same, and that you must convert to the Charismatic faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_snake_convert;The vision is clear!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_snake_convert_deny;I will not turn from my faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_snake_convert_vassal;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was bitten by a serpent during a holy ritual service.

EVTDESC_vision_amerind;Your people undertake vision quests within a carefully constructed wooden sweat lodge. You will spend days within the lodge, fasting and meditating under close supervision of the firekeeper. Your spiritual journey will take you far beyond the walls of the lodge, to commune with [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].\n\nA seeker often sees startling things.

EVTDESC_vision_meso;For a ruler of your standing, the [Root.Religion.GetName] vision quest tradition begins with a bloody human sacrifice.

EVTDESC_vision_pagan;A vision quest in the [Root.Religion.GetName] tradition can be a dangerous activity.

EVTNAME_vision_war;Vision of War;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_war_die;An armored rider wheels towards you, a great plume of feathers on his cap. The air is thick with arrows, but the rider ignores them. Your arms are heavy, and the rider's spear finds your throat.
;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_war_siege;You stand atop a high bluff, your banner crisp in the wind. Below you lies an ocean of men... soldiers beyond counting. In the distance, a great fortress burns.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_war_ride;Your horse is swift, and your arm is strong. A trumpet looses a mighty blast. You ride across the dusty ground with your companions, your hooves like rolling thunder.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_war_carnage;You stand in a bloody field, strewn with bodies. An injured soldier struggles to stand, using his weapon for support. Carrion birds circle overhead and a wolf howls to summon the pack.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_vision_wond;Vision of Wonder;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_vision_wond_river;You are carried by the current of a vast river. You need not steer, the magic of the river guides you. You need not eat, the warmth of the Sun sustains you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_wond_field;You walk through a waist-high field of golden grass. The grass parts as you pass, rippling in the breeze like the surface of a lake. You raise your hand to shield your eyes from the Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_wond_kindle;Points of flickering orange light are kindled in the darkness. Soon, you cannot tell where the countless campfires end and the stars begin. You too must kindle a flame in the ashes of the old world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_vision_self_luke;You swing your blade forcefully at your armored opponent, striking his neck. He is beheaded, and the strength of the blow knocks a shower of black lacquer chips loose from his armor. With a puff of smoke, your opponent's face is revealed to be yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_vision_universe;The Universe;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_universe;Your visions have shown you deep truths about the nature of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] and the Universe.

EVTDESC_vision_madness;You have seen so many terrible things that your sanity is slipping away. Time seems to lose all meaning, and you feel as though your soul has been sharply separated from your body. \n\nWaves of terror, helplessness, and despair pass over you.

EVTNAME_vision_nothing;Nothingness;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_vision_nothing;In the end, your attempts to contact the spiritual world have come to naught. Others see visions of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] or hear soothing voices that guide them, but you have found only a terrible black void.\n\nRather than communing with the Universe, you are simply alone with your own thoughts.
